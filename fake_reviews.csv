-1,"This is a beautiful quaint little restaurant on a pretty street.  If you're strolling through soho around lunchtime, this would be a great place to stop for a bite. I heard the reviews about the lamb sandwich, so I had to try it. I'm very happy that i did. Every single ingredient - from the bread to the onions and tomatoes, the lamb and the sauce - was delicious. These four stars are well deserved because of the tasty sandwich and great ambiance.  I would recommend this place to anyone."
-1,"Peppinos is far superior to your typical neighborhood slice shop but it isn't a destination pizza place. The staff is friendly to a fault, which almost makes up for the errors in their food. 2 out of the last 3 times that I've ordered pies from them, they have put the wrong toppings on the pies. I'm not a picky guy but it is annoying when you are paying $20 + for a pizza. I'm not sure what the issue is but I hope they get it fixed. Delivery service is inconsistent in delivery time (15-45 minutes) but the food does arrive hot every time. In addition to their pies their salads and sandwiches are also delicious, especially the pepperoni hero."
-1,Great pizza! My go to place when I want something that hits the spot. They use all fresh ingredients and they are very generous with their pizza topping . Def check them out if you haven't already .. You won't be disappointed
-1,"This probably one of my top 10 favorite restaurants! I order the ravioli and it was amazing! The marina sauce was the best, Homemade and delicious. Though I recommend coming in hungry because it fills you up and portion are kinda big. It was a like I was in Italy and the atmosphere is very laid back.   Definitely A must if your visiting New York!"
-1,"Great place, great food. I have in both Brooklyn locations and have almost enjoy a good meal."
-1,"This place is pretty close to perfect.  Amazing brick oven, wood fired pizza, incredible heros made with homemade, amazing dough.  Sauce is fresh, barely touched using great products.  Incredibly warm and nice staff both in person and on the phone.  This isn't a complaint but a request.... I wish they had a few more appetizer choices, i think they could do a really good fried mozzarella app, fried calamari, maybe an arancine? I also wish they would make a clam pizza which when done well by great pizza restaurants is absolutely amazing.   I just feel like they would do everything well and this would be great.  Keep it up Peppinos, you guys are great in every way."
-1,"Food is creative and thought provoking - but make sure you eat before you go.  Portions are ridiculously small and left me feeling short-changed and hungry.  Had the celery oyster stew.  I know it's Brooklyn, but since when did potato and oyster cracker filler cost this much?  The stew scarcely covered the bottom of a cavernous bowl.  Conversation throughout dinner tended to echo off the exposed sides of said bowl. Heard every story twice.  Dekalb, maybe focus less on furbishing the walls of your restaurant, and more on furbishing the walls of my bowl of cheap-ingredient-yet-fancy-named-stew.  Probably won't be a next time. P.S. Semi-redeeming quality: Squash Tots.  Good concept, but ""squash"" becomes more of a verb upon meeting a fork."
-1,"The food was good and the atmosphere very nice - but unfortunately the NYC heath inspection reveals several serious violations - nyc.gov/html/doh/html/se… Violations recorded in the following area (s) and a Notice of Violation issued at the reinspection conducted on 07/22/2013.

-1,Went there last sunday with my gf. We both enjoyed the food - especially the carpaccio and also the mussels were delicious. Try the creme brûlée - it was fantastic!
-1,I am a fan!
-1,Lovely little french bistro hidden in Murray Hills.  We felt like we were truly in France/paris.  The staff paid excellent attention to us and the dover sole was to die for!!!!!!  Great wine selection.  Very small restaurant but just as cozy as it can be.  I recommend!!
-1,"The most amazing food i've had in New York so far! I had the pate to start and the mussels for main- beautiful flavours and good sized portions. mum had a pear and walnut salad to start (she still can't stop talking about it!) and salmon for main. Service was great and the wine was delicious. 5/5, highly recommended!"
-1,"Le Parisien is what NYC was missing. An authentic french bistro. Period. The atmosphere is real (Christian, the owner, professional and friendly,  was born in Paris, and has worked in the best restaurants in NY for 20 years), the food is to die for and very affordable (classic dishes like escargots, frisee lardon poached egg, pate, soupe du jour, steak frites (home-made), confit de canard, etc... as well as creative dishes like a cod fish with mashed potatoes and black olives, skate with pumpkin risotto, moules frites with saffron, etc...). As far as the wines, you can either order a glass (10 different options), carafe or bottle. As a french native, i hardly recommend this new restaurant (opened last july and already packed). Also, great date place because it's cosy, and the music is very low, so you can talk ! Also, the $11.95 brunch is worth a cab ride if you don't live midtown. Bon appetit !"
-1,lady that works there picks her nose. - yuck!
-1,"I used to love this place when it was Xunta-a very authentic Spanish tapas bar, casual, informal bar with tapas and a great atmosphere - so I went for years, bringing many out of town visitors and friends for happy hour and on weekends. Now, sadly, I have to say that Nai is not the same place and not worth spending your money there. The new owner has made a lot of changes, for the worse, imo, and is very strange (looks like some dude from Queens)-he seems to be always there,with a scowl on his face, is neither inviting nor welcoming, and acts dismissive and like he is  doing you a favor even talking to  you-when we even show up early for reservations and have done nothing except wanting to patronize his bar! He runs the place like a formal dining restaurant..it feels like you have to be in exactly on time, spend your pricepoint, and get out-all very anti-tapas bar to me. At my  birthday celebration of 10 people, he actually did ask us to leave after 2 hours because he ""needed"" the table though we had spent several hundred dollars and were still eating and drinking! I was flabbergasted at how rude that was.  Also I noticed that since the change to Nai, the food is not as good as it used to be (octopus and other dishes not cooked well), with higher prices as well, and the sangria is now also watered down/sweet imo--just not a good value. And the décor now is blah (think tacky flamenco paintings from homedecorators.com)-does not have any of the charm or personality of the old Xunta. Sadly, after giving it a go a couple of times, I am in search once again of an authentic Spanish tapas bar."
-1,Pros -Decent value -Friendly and kind service -Accommodates large groups Cons -Tons of loud groups -Not intimate at all
-1,"I came here with two other people for a book club meeting. It was happy hour, so we ordered a $10 half-pitcher of mango sangria, which was DELICIOUS. Also, almost all the food we ordered (tortilla, potatos w/ aioli, tropical salad) was flavorful and well-made. My friends ordered the chorizo with onions, which looked and smelled good, too (I didn't have any because I'm a vegetarian). The only exception was the asparagus tapas, which was actually pretty gross--I had to force myself to eat it because I hate wasting food. There were only two small pieces of asparagus, which were horribly overcooked and mushy (possible from a can), very cold, and drenched in mayonnaise. Our waiter was very friendly and engaging when we arrived, and did a cool long pour of the sangria, though he seemed to forget about us later on. But overall, this was a positive experience and I recommend this place."
-1,"Excellent spot, not much to add to the other reviews."
-1,"Nai tapas is my local favorite, I have gone back at least 5 times in the past three months. Try to make it there for happy hour and get a pitcher or half pitcher of their sangria. It may not be strong but it's tasty and goes well with the 3-4 orders of tapas you shoul get there (or more depending on the group size). Tropical and mango are definitely my favorite nai tapas sangria flavors and highly recommend trying both especially if you like fruity flavors. Some menu favorites I always go back for: -Patatas Bravas -Croquetas de pollo -Mejillones Rias Baixas Also stop in for the amazing service :) the staff really makes an attempt to check on you and get to know you. I always love introducing new friends to this place for that and the amazing flamenco shows they have on Thursdays (I think they also have one over the weekend) but I've only seen the one on Thursday and it is truly a magnificent experience. You can't take pictures (it's distracting) which is a good thing because it's something worth experiencing through the naked eye."
-1,"Everything on the menu here is great. My favorite are the chipirones in their own ink, the bacalaos, the stuffed olives, the salteado de gambas, and pretty much everything I've tried! The entire staff is extremely friendly and eager to please. I also love that  their food is always served HOT. The best part, though, is that it's a pretty cheap place to eat."
-1,"Amazing place with amazing service. We had the best time enjoying tapas and the show. The tapas were delicious and the sangria was delicious but more like juice rather than an alcoholic drink. The show on saturday night was absolutely one of the best flamenco shows I've ever seen. The performances lasted a few hours, it was amazing to see the women dance full of passion and energy. We all had an amazing time and I can't wait to come back."
-1,"An amazing find. I was looking for a restaurant to celebrate my birthday with a group of 12. I also wanted to find a spot that had a flamenco show on Saturdays. As soon as I came in to make reservations, I knew this place would be great. The decor is great; it's an intimate, low-lit place with exposed brick walls. Dinner was amazing. The best part was definitely the flamenco show. It is free, and lasts for hours. The dancers and singers were top notch!!! I felt like I was back in Madrid watching a show. The service was also amazing; with such a big group, our waiter was always available, smiled, and served us very quickly. The food was good, and there is a big variety of sangria. The prices for the tapas were also very reasonable. There is a flamenco show every Thursday & Saturday at 8:30. It is a must!"
-1,"I was there on Saturday night with three friends and what a great place!  We ate a total of eight tapas, had two pitchers of sangria and we each paid around twenty dollars with tip included.  Great food, great service, low prices and an awesome flamenco show.  We will definitely be back."
-1,"Tiny which makes for a good ambience.  The food ranges from okay to good, but in my opinion is over styled and thus slightly unappetizing.  Honestly can't even remember what I ate which is a bad sign. Fun if you're looking for a BYO but definitely better in the area.   Also the owner is a bit odd.  He can be very friendly but is unorganized. I once had a reservation on a week night and he did not put a large table aside for our party of 6- instead he had us sitting separately waiting for other parties to leave.  It was awkward and annoying. Supposedly good for brunch, but I've only been there for dinner."
-1,Hole In the wall.  To crammed for my tastes. I got the egg scramble which came with a side salad.  The side salad wasn't very fresh.
-1,"Beware, it's a really tight space. You might be hearing more of the convo at the table next to you than the one at your own table! But everything else about it was pretty decent. I wasn't much of a fan of the mushroom things everyone else seems to love--what even are those?! The food was moderately priced for what you're getting though I guess. I went with friends on a Friday evening, so I dunno if it's like this at other times (looks like more neg reviews for the brunch crowd), but it was a pretty okay scene as far as ambiance or whatever and my group took major advantage of the BYOB policy and brought a shit ton of alc. So after we started drinking I think everything actually got better. My overall feeling is ehhh but it can be good if you bring enough beer."
-1,"I liked this place very much but was a little frustrated because it took an hour to get our food even though there were only 3 tables with customers.  Also, what kind of restaurant doesn't have a bathroom for the customers?! Aside from that, their food is good and it has a cozy atmosphere.  I reccomend their rosemary fries and mushroom cigars"
-1,"Small, quaint place in the theater district - so small we walked past it twice! Took a friend from out of town here on a weekday evening. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Our meal were great - I ordered the large shrimp salad and asked for the dressing on the side. The waiter bet me the cost of my meal that the salad should be served dressed...and he was right! Everything was delicious. Would definitely come back for a low key evening or date night."
-1,Wonderful food. Got there 1030am and had to wait for like 15 mins. The mashed potatoes are amazing! The pancakes were just okay but the eggs were wonderful!
-1,"The food was delicious. The service is friendly and quick. Their brunch menu has yummy potato pancakes and a salmon dish. Their other menus include mushroom cigars - greasy but great, and other nice meat/fish/veg edibles. Overall, a good experience."
-1,"Snapshot: 1) Fantastic food 2) Quality service 3) BYOB (with no cork fee) 4) Cash only 5) Small space (won't fit large groups) Meal Experience: When my wife and I entered, we were immediately warmly greeted by the owner, Konrad. We were seated and he brought out a large corked bottle of water and bread (complimentary when you are seated). We ordered the mushroom cigars as an appetizer, based on Konrad's recommendation. I must say, I normally am not much of a mushroom guy, but these may have converted me. They were fantastic! I could have ordered a couple of those and made that my meal. For the entree, I ordered the Tuscan chicken (which was rolled with spinach and a cheese) and my wife ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger with balsamic sauce and goat cheese. Rosemary fries on the side. They were both really wonderful! In all, I would highly recommend this place."
-1,tiny place with excellent food and service
-1,Brunch started off with the kind of fresh baked bread that you scarf up even though you know it will fill you up. The apple pancakes were delicious as was the savory cheddar burger and rosemary fries. My only regret is I didn't have the mushroom soup! Coffee and water was kept filled to the brim by our attentive server. The place is small but the seating is comfortable and it's great people watching. Looking forward to going back.
-1,"Great place for the neighborhood, whether dinner or brunch. Really enjoyed the atmosphere there and definitely the food. BYOB!"
-1,"I am a big fan of South American cuisine. To me the Pio Pio has an excellent Peruvian selection, accompany by flavorful sauces and fantastic rotisserie. So when I tried Pio Pio Riko in Chelsea I expected the same quality of food and I was severely disappointed. The chicken was dry to the bone, the amazing green sauce I love so much, Ahi Verde, was white and thick and tasted like paper towel. The beans were watery, very salty, flavorless, and the service, especially delivery, was just awful. I ordered over the phone, in Spanish, since it seems to be easier, and even after I repeated the order twice, I was delivered the wrong thing. Moreover, the delivery boy, Oscar I think his name was, was very inappropriate. Not only was he asking me questions like how much money I make and if I'm married, he smelled of something terrible. My friend, who was accepting the order with me, stated it may have been the smell of marijuana. In any event, this experience did not dampen my love for Peruvian food, but I will definitely stick to the original Pio Pio and stay away from this knock off."
-1,"Loved it.  The gentleman saw me thinking about while on my way to stage door diner.  I absolutely loved the food and service.  The chicken was great as advertised, the sweet plantains and tostones were delish.  Great price.  I'm definitely a fan"
-1,"From the outside it doesnt look like much but when you walk in its actually quite a large restaurant. Since it was busy we decided to sit at the bar and eat as we were hungry. I could see the staff were very busy, but they did well to take our orders as the girls behind the bar were serving drinks and food! They needed a pay rise! The food was great here, i wanted to go back but we ended up at other places. I would recommend eating here. Simple but tasty food that is well priced."
-1,"Went here for the first time on New Year's Eve. Had the Prefix meal. Smoked trout, scallops, pork shank, sweet potato cobbler with maple/whiskey ice cream, and some rum cocktail topped w/ champagne. Blown away; food was slammin. Kelly was our server; he was basically perfect. I'd go back again."
-1,"After reading such rave reviews about this vendor's falafel, I was excited to try it for myself. I was very disappointed after the first bite. The falafel were soggy and overly salty. The onion slices were very thick and any bite with it had an overpowering onion-y flavor to it. The white sauce had no taste to it. Also, I'm not a fan of pickles and was surprised to find them in my wrap. The pita was the best part of the wrap to be honest- it was soft but not chewy. The fact that I did not eat the wrap right away or the very hot weather might have played a role in my sub par eating experience, but I also suspect that the falafels I was served were not fresh (I was told to wait a few minutes for falafels and saw one worker putting more in the oil and just a second later, my wrap was ready, before the freshly dropped ones were fetched from the oil). Seeing that this vendor has so many followers, I may give it another shot in the future, but not any time soon."
-1,"i really wanted to like this place after hearing about it from so many friends and family. I checked it out, the owner is a great funny guy, but the food is sub par. the chicken is bland and its just bad. the falafel was good, but it justify the meat and rice. I enjoyed sammys a lot more."
-1,"In love with there falafel and sharma, would have given it 5 stars but they brought up the prices."
-1,Great falafel is out of this world. !!! Great food ...
-1,The Halal cart on Broadway is one of the best deals in Astoria.  Although their chicken rice plates can be a little inconsistent at times (warning - when it's slow) - it's usually the most amazing six dollar meal you can find. Their falafel is always amazing - and I love the little salad on the side - with the pickled turnips.  Always always go for the white and red (hot) sauce - they go together like peas and carrots. Also for a change of pace - the combo plate (kefta and chicken) is a great deal and when you are in a carnivorous mood - their beef kebabs are mouth wateringly tender and an amazing addition to your plate for 2 bucks. As good as it gets for lunch (or a quick dinner) in Astoria - you can catch me there at least once if not twice a week!
-1,"Believe the hype. This cart is amazing. I once got there and the line was all the way to the c town. I wondered whether or not it was worth the wait. People got in line behind me so I decided it was and was not disappointed. They give you a piece of falafel while you wait and their energy and good cheer is contagious. The food is to die for..any of it, all of it. I keep going back to try more and i cant get enough!"
-1,"So freaking delicious I have to stop myself from coming here every night. All the chicken dishes are phenomenal and even if you skip the rice and just do chicken and salad (to save a few calories?), it's addictive. The falafel is perfectly crispy and light.  Yum!"
-1,"They really make amazing shawarma... I always wanted to try shawarma, because it greatly reminds me of the Turkish kebab, and the Greek gyros pitta. I traveled to this place, so eager to taste the shawarma. The meat was really amazing, and they make their food with care, you can tell by the taste and the very look of the food. It smells and tastes godly. Everything is so fresh, and you can simply feel the authentic taste. I really liked it. If you have any doubts about this place, please just go there and try it for yourself, experience divinity !"
-1,"This place is literally the best Halal style food you'll be able to find in the whole city. Not even generalizing it. I've tried many different places and this one still beats them out on the quantity and quality of food you get. Freddy is always a blast to talk to and keeps the atmosphere alive as he and his coworkers are making your food. Try his own creation ""Freddy's Jr."". Completely worth the $7 you're paying for it. I'm a fan of spicy food so nothing from this food turns me away. Don't let other reviews discourage you! If you notice, 95% are 4+ stars, so if a couple of people rate it a bit less, that's all on them and how picky they are. King of Falafel and Shawarma definitely deserved their Vendy, and its about time they got it."
-1,I am hooked! I am moving to Astoria just for this cart!
-1,"This is THE Halal Cart in the five boros, forget about that 53rd and 6th BS. This the best chicken and rice cart on Earth. Not only do they make chicken and rice but they also make Kofta, Shawarma, Shish kebabs, and also lamb chops. I have had the chicken and rice, lamb chops, and sandwiches. The style is different from most Halal carts that take a spin on South Asian curried chicken, this one is Middle Eastern style. I used to live near this cart and bought food from it several times a week, never got tired of it. Its pricier than other carts, $6 for the basic chicken and rice dish and $10 for the lamb chops, pricey but you get excellent food. And the salad you get with your food is real salad not some lame lettuce leaves. There are a lot of fairly pricey sit down restaurants in the area but this cart beats them all on their superior food and friendly service."
-1,"By far the best truck/cart food I've ever had.  Better than 99% of the restaurants in which I've eaten, including ones where they check your Amex platinum card before they let you in.  (Don't ask how I got into places like those!)  And those guys are sweethearts. I've eaten every kind of plate, wrap and kebab they make, and I still can't make up my mind which is best.  Like most people, I've eaten the chicken and rice plate most often.  But I like to eat the schwarma--the best I've had--or ""Freddy's Junior Plate,"" with chicken and kefta on rice.   You can get yellow rice, but I recommend the basmati:  It's very aromatic and flavorful. One caveat:  They will lard your dish with white and/or hot sauces unless you tell them otherwise.  I like a little bit of white and a good dose of the hot sauce.  And, yes, I take my plates and wraps with salad, mainly because I love those pickled beets. And ya gotta love those guys and their sign.  If any of them were single, I'd  take him home with me!  I mean, come on, nice guys with a sense of humor who can cook (and are kinda cute, at least to me): Where ya gonna find that?"
-1,"We showed up for our reservation and had to wait an HOUR!!  Their tiny waiting area was already packed with people so we wound up standing for about 20 mins before finally getting a seat.  After waiting just a little over an hour, we were finally graced with a table.  We were treated as if we were just another number (we are locals not tourists) and chose Bouley to celebrate our 20th Anniversary.  The food and service did NOT live up to the hype and while the space is romantic it was very hard to enjoy the ambiance when everything else was just WRONG.  We won't ever return but it seemed very clear to us that they wouldn't care even if we did."
-1,"We were looking forward to an amazing dinner at Bouley to celebrate our marriage. We were less than impressed. The lobster was cold and overcooked. I ate only a few bites but was never asked if it was OK before it was cleared away.  The service was average. And I agree with the review about feeling uncomfortable in the restaurant.  I would never recommend this less than average restaurant to anyone. And, at $150 per person, you can do much better in NYC than this stuffy restaurant."
-1,"Such bad service.  We waited 15-20 minutes for the waitress to take our order, then another hour for our food and the restaurant wasn't packed. The food was average at best."
-1,"Great ambiance, the foie gras was too rich and bland"
-1,"Probably 3.5 stars.  I had some interesting food here at lunch.  They favor bitter greens too much for my taste, and the beef cheeks were just OK.  The wife's chicken was pretty terrible.  But she had some sort of egg concoction that was lovely, and I had a nice soup.  I dig the space as well, particularly downstairs."
-1,"The first time I ate at Bouley was in 1996. My mother in-law took my husband (fiancée at that time) and me for dinner to celebrate our graduating Graduate School from Columbia. The experience for me was beyond divine. Even though it was almost 12 years ago, I still remember being delighted by every course we were served! Little did I know at that time that Bouley would close down that very year. I've never forgotten that meal. I really think it was one of the best meals I have ever had....in my entire life! So, after 12 long years of Bouley having closed, reopened, moved locations and so on, I finally went back to try it one more time.This time I went for lunch. They have a great pre-fix deal for lunch for $48. I have to say that overall I was disappointed with this meal. The two outstanding things I ate were the Crab-Porcini mushroom flan and the dessert. The rest of the meal was just okay. I would go back again though. Bouley is such a charming place, with impeccable service and grace. I really enjoyed the experience and parts of the meal were outstanding. It's hard to judge a place like Bouley based on just one meal and one menu. I still believe that Chef David Bouley can recreate the magic that I experienced 12 years ago and I am willing to go back and try."
-1,"Just so we'll be absolutely clear about it: A couple will pay at least 350$ in the evening. We never had a dinner that expensive. Saying that, it was one of the best meal of our lives. Everything you'll taste will be accurate delicate and new, and simply will blow you away."
-1,We had a group of 50 people. The dinner took 3 hours plus. The food wasn't the usual bouley quality. But I suppose it's hard to serve 50 people.
-1,Great food! Love the atmosphere and dinning area.
-1,Very expensive but heavenly gooood.... Love it!
-1,"A must try when in NYC.  We went for the lunch tasting and it was so good!  I would fly to New York just to go to this restaurant again. The lunch tasting came with 5 courses, all very delicious.  The added bread cart with its fancy breads (e.g. pistachio saffron) was a nice touch. The restaurant was beautiful.  Walking in you are greeted with a wall of fresh apples from floor to ceiling, a nice sweet smell. Trust me and try it."
-1,"The service was flawless from the time we arrived till the moment we left. Everything was fantastic, I went with my wife and some friends and they gave us a very big and comfortable table. I have to say that the food was really beyond my expectations. I had the Porccini Flan as appetizer and the Lamb as entree. My wife had the shrimp and scallops, I've tried some and it was delightful. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
-1,"Everything was so perfect. The place is amazing, the service is great and the food unbelievable. The restaurant is specifically dedicated to private or corporate events. The kitchen is open to the dining room and you see the cooks working. The room is full of herbs that they use to cook. The Chef came to say hi ! And to share his approach. Great place."
-1,"We ate at Bouley for our 5th anniversary and it was by far, the most amazing dinner we had ever had. We both had their tasting menu with the wine pairing and the food, wine, and service was incredible! (and we are both avid cooks ourselves!) Our servers gave us a special dessert and 6th course (for free) for our anniversary. It was well worth the money, our hats off to Mr. David Bouley!"
-1,Start saving now. Make reservations. The atmosphere hints at European but is so comfortable. Ask for the booth facing the door so you can people watch. The bakery is next stuff your pockets with the bread but not your face. Leave room for everything & demurely lick your plate. The service is as memorable as the food. I have eaten at many wonderful New York restaurants and this is the best. The food is farm to fork fresh and prepared with creativity and delicacy. Do lunch; then you can continue to savor the flavors all day.
-1,"This restaurant is special. I had a party of four and we were seated at a spacious round table. The wait staff is superb - friendly and professional. I can't say enough about how the staff enhanced the experience. They were just wonderful. I was running late and called to ask the staff to take care of my guests. They seated my guests and took care of them until I arrived. They get all stars for being so nice. The food is great, the decor is fabulous."
-1,Excellent! One of the best places to bring a date.. was there for lunch today. excellent!
-1,"If asked for a restaurant recommendation, Bouley is almost always one of the recommendations I will give.  When you first walk into the restaurant, you are greeted by a small room with fresh apples lining the walls.  The aroma is just fantastic--I could spend an hour just sitting there taking it in.  The restaurant itself is a very quaint, well decorated space.  It probably borders a little bit on the stuffy side, especially since jackets are required here, but I will easily forgive that shortcoming for the quality of the food.   Oh, the food--definitely among the best I have ever had.  Whether it is the peach soup, the wild mushrooms, the very famous porcini flan, or the Long Island duck, each dish at this restaurant brings out the most unique flavors of the ingredients and highlights them on your palette.  In the middle of your meal, a cart with around 7 types of different artisan breads will roll around and deliver to you slices from whichever ones you want to try.  I found the garlic and fig breads to both be very delicious.  And at the end of your meal, after your dessert, they will bring a little tower of confections to your table as a nice way to end your meal.  On your way out, you may also get a loaf or two of fresh pound cake for the road!  Everything I have had at Bouley in my two visits here has been absolutely amazing--words do not do it justice. Almost equally as good as the food Bouley offers is the value they offer.  Lunch prix fixe is only $55 for a 5 course meal (5 courses outside of the bread and confections).  Of course dinner is much more expensive, but that just makes it in line with other restaurants of its caliber.  I like to recommend this place to friends who need to take a larger group to a nice meal b/c it doesn't break the bank and the food is really just amazing.  I highly recommend Bouley and look forward to returning yet again in the future."
-1,"The dining room was beautiful, and the servers were attentive and friendly. We spilled a glass of wine (the last of our bottle) and the sommelier soon brought us each a complimentary glass. That was a nice touch! The food was spectacular! Try the duck, the chocolate soufflé and the artisan breads. This place is a must and is now our go to French restaurant in New York!"
-1,"I wend to this restaurant a few months back with family. It was an overall excellent experience: from the service to the food, even the waiting area was unique with the rows of apples (which everyone seem to mention in their reviews as well). The choices for artisan bread complemented the excellent tasting menu. I definitely recommend choosing the flan, even if a supplement will be necessary. Though the prohibitive price makes the restaurant somewhat harder to approach, the satisfaction from eating at such a dressy place is unparalleled. I always use to say, you can truly tell how good a restaurant is by the quality of its bathroom, and this one definitely earns 5 stars."
-1,"I went with my husband to celebrate his bday and it was one of the best dining for both. The service was excellent, they gave us several extra goodies including a bday cake for us to take to our hotel... Also, the food was extraordinary... We are spanish speakers so they send us a spanish waitress... The ambience is really elegant. I recommend this restaurant with close eyes and I can not wait to visit New York city again to enjoy this fine dining experience. Thums up... and Thanks to all the employees that let us live such a lovely moment."
-1,"My friend Cici and I love a great deal, so we decided to go for the $55 prix-fixe 5 course lunch at Bouley today. The restaurant was beautiful, with fresh flowers everywhere.  Cici commented that the waiters were serving like a well-rehearsed symphony. Once in awhile, you would get a whiff of truffles. The lunch started with an amuse bouche: pumpkin soup with candied pine nuts. It reminded me of the soup I used to buy at the now closed Bouley Market. The soup was so creamy and pumpkin-y that I wished Bouley Market is still open. For our first course, we both chose the Carpaccio Of Kampachi, Young Blue Fin Tuna And Striped Amber Jack prepared in a mediterranean manne.  The plate was so pretty, it looked like fish swimming in a pool of pretty green flowers.  The carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh with the most wonderful sauces. We were fascinated by the guy wheeling around the bread in a cart like one of those dim sum ladies. He was so into methodically cutting the bread that he belonged in a movie about Bouley, or bread, or just any movie. He suggested the Saffron walnut bread with the porcini flan. I also tried the apricot walnut bread (sweet, chewy and fresh) and olive bread. I still think Del Posto has the best bread in the city though. The second course was the famous Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab black truffle dashi in its own little pot.  I can see why so many people recommend the flan. The crab meat was outrageously crabby and fresh.  I believe this dish is what makes the air smell like truffles every once in awhile, when someone is served the porcini flan and they open the little pot and let the aroma envelop them (an apparently everyone else) in a cloud of truffle bliss. For the third course, Cici picked the All-Natural Pennsylvania Chicken with carrot ravioli, chanterelles, pain d'empics dressing and I picked the Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks with blue kale gnocchi.   Cici gave me a bite of her chicken and carrot ravioli. This was not the usual frozen chicken you get at other restaurants. I want, no NEED, the secret of how they make the chicken so tender.  Is it because it's all natural or from Pennsylvania?  We need to know. This chicken was so tender, it makes other so called ""chicken tenders"" taste like leather (Cici said ""old shoe"" but I'm not as gross as her).  ""They are like chicken meltaways!"" Cici later texted me as she finished her chicken that she took home in a doggie bag (more on that later).   Also, the carrot raviloli was so sweet and the pasta delectible, it tasted like pumpkin.  (Before this, my only other taste of a sweet vegetable ravioli are the butternut squash raviolis at Costco.  This aint no Costco ravioli, people!  I am not a snob, I just like good food.)   The beef was delicious as well, with gnocchi on the bottom, but by then I was too full to fully appreciate the beef, however yummy it was. Next, came a palate cleanser of Honey Tangerine Soup with sancho pepper, lychee sorbet, crystallized honey.  Very refreshing and perfect after all the courses. We both picked the Hot Caramilized Anjou Pear,valrhona chocolate, biscuit breton, hot toffee sauce, lemon verbena and tahitian vanilla ice creams for dessert.  I did not like the lemon verbena ice cream too much, reminded me of Lemon Pledge.  Sorry.  The chef provided us an extra dessert: bulgur wheat ice cream. It was a unique taste, creamy and kind of salty. The chef also presented some complimentary, gorgeous little macarons, wafer thin cookies, chocolates and nut crunch.   We did not finish our desserts so we asked for doggie bags. The server who cleared the table acted like this was an unusual request. Yes, we are Hoi polloi.  We take doggie bags. We are not on a date and we don't care. Plus, it's a Michelin Star doggie bag. If you think we are declasse for asking for doggie bags, witness what happened at the next table: The two guys next to us (not in jackets, as required by the restaurant rules) obviously tourists due to the hotel room key card on the table (see, no little detail escapes me, a skill I honed after watching almost all the Monk reruns), sat down later than us, so by the time their table was cleared for dessert, we were done with our meal.  One of the guys (with an accent) asked for *gasp* more bread.  The server said incredulously, ""More bread, with DESSERT?""  Amateurs.  Tourists.  Didn't they know that we New Yawkers don't eat bread with dessert?  Suddenly, it was as if the perfect symphony came to a screeching halt for a second.  The bread guy was notified of the request, and he went over and asked which bread they would like to enjoy some more.  They chose the apricot walnut (good choice).  Bread Guy said, ""Let me get you a plate, would you like butter with that?""  Then all was well again as the two bread-loving gentlemen were served their desserts.  The doggie bags were discreetly given to us by the receptionist/coat check girl.  Go to my blog for more of this review."
-1,"Five of us had a marvelous lunch at Bouley on Saturday, Feb 11.  The interior design transported me to another beautiful world.  Everywhere I looked there was something to see, from carved antique doors and fruit-themed chandeliers to huge floral bouquets and lovely drapery.  The French sommelier charmingly picked out a reasonably priced wine for us from the rather intimidating wine binder.   Our waiter knew all the details about our food and even told us how to make the salad dressing at home.  I ordered the salad with Bibb lettuce, watercress, hearts of palm and mushrooms.  It was superb.  All the china is unique and beautiful.  I was so tempted to flip the pieces over and read the bottoms.  I ordered the porcini flan with Dungeness crab which was also perfect.  My entree was chicken with vegetables.  By that time, however, I had eaten too much of the bread. One server pushed around a bread cart with 6 different wonderful breads to try and I overdid it. Dessert was sublime--a hot caramelized pear with toffee sauce and ice cream.   I felt like I was having lunch in a welcoming, elegant home.  Our group of five people had cocktails, a bottle of wine and the full 5-course tasting menu.  It came to $110 a person including a 20% tip.  The lunch was worth every penny.  Absolutely loved it.   I'm from San Francisco and my friends can be kind of snarky and find faults with lots of things. Aside from the busgirl who was rather dreary and bored, we found not one fault at Bouley. P.S. Don't know if I would have wanted to sit in the downstairs eating area as much."
-1,"This restaurant is flawless from start to finish. The food and presentation are impeccable, matched by the ambiance and service. Every item was memorable. We love New York and it's incredible array of restaurants, but this one stands at the very top. Don't miss this one if you're seeking a wonderful experience."
-1,"We spent our wedding anniversary at Bouley 3 years ago. So sorry I'm writing a review now! This was my second time, and hubby's first. I had the pleasure of having dinner at Bouley with coworkers and clients when I was dating hubby, and he was so jealous! I really don't have anything to add to how fantastic the $175 tasting menu was. They kept feeding us with wonderful cookies and dessert just because it was our wedding anniversary until we were so full and needed a break! One thing I remember was I was on my way to the ladies' room, and the head waiter stopped the traffic in the hallway for me so that I could make it safely to the bathroom. His gesture made me feel like a queen! I ordered a book written by Danny Meyer for a friend today who wants to start a restaurant. DM opened Shake Shack, restaurants at the Museum of Modern Art, restaurants that haven been around so long, they became institutions. DM talks about how the service is so important. I'm pretty sure the service at Bouley is what separates it from other restaurants in addition to the fantastic dishes it serves."
-1,"I have not been to Bouley.  I visited the website and tried to find the menu, with no luck.  No menu, no go... This is not fair of me to rate Bouley solely on the website -- but, please, post a menu just to help us diners with enthusiastic taste buds!  If I missed the menu on the site, please help me..."
-1,"Ive been here several times and it is ALWAYS THE BEST!!! Literally the best meal ive ever had. Im a newlywed and I just brought my Southern husband here and it blew his mind as well. The food is truly FOOD AT ITS FINEST!!! I highly recommend the tuna, crab soup (not sure the exact name..it is one of the first choices on prix-fixe), the skate, the duck, venison or chicken,.....oh EVERYTHING is phenomenal here. Best meal either me or my husband has ever had!"
-1,Decor is amazing. Service is amazing.
-1,"One of our most memorable meals in NYC. A standout favorite was the perfectly roasted duck. Nice little touches with the service, petit fours and amuse bouche was a really nice addition. Very knowledgeable, friendly wait staff."
-1,"Had the tasting menu and it was fantsastic! The porcini flan was served with crab and had a nice truffle flavor, my husband had the chilled oysters with caviar, which was better than mine! We both ordered the wild salmon that had a nice amaranth seed crust, I cant even begin to describe how delicisou this was!   We also love the organic egg tasting can't describe how orgasmic our meal was we will definitely be back!"
-1,"I love the food & experience! The atmosphere carries you to somehwere else, the service as well. But the main reason to bring yourself to that part of town is the food ! Each serving is perfect  and most of them will surprise your taste buds. Go for lunch tasting menu, it makes the experience very affordable."
-1,"Casa Adela, this small family-style eatery behind Tompkins, has it right. It's got a casual atmosphere, a mix of Puerto Rican regulars and hipsters, and tip-top home-style cooking. Try the Chicken Stew, finish with a hand-made espresso, and you can't go wrong. Also BYOB, but don't tell."
-1,"Auth! Great food! My partner and I skipped only a day out of her 4-day NY visit... She even bought some for her fam before leaving NY :) when she got inside Casa Adela, she said it smells just like her grandma's kitchen...very authentic PR resto... You made her extra happy :) thanks! u gave us such happy tummies! keep it up! Friendly people and great food...."
-1,"I love this place. I am so glad that my family and I went there this weekend. The food taste like my mother-in-laws on the island. It was a little hard to find, and the parking was okay very New York city if you know what I mean. However, the food will make you forget all of that. The pork chops are so good and cooked to perfection, man I wish I had one now. Go there don't waist your time looking for any-other place  good there you will enjoy it. Did I mension the arroz con habicuelas okay just go"
-1,awesome! great service
-1,"Best acai bowl in New York! I stumbled into Two Hands off the street looking for a quick coffee and ended up staying a couple of hours. I'm not sure if it was the big smile on the barrister's face or if the coffee actually tasted like heaven in a cup. Either way, I now have a new coffee spot in lower manhattan. Definitely worth a visit. If the chilled atmosphere doesn't take you away then the food will."
-1,Second visit to the restaurant second time my our reservations were not set for agreed upon time.  And curious if they charge for the attitude or is it free?
-1,"Possibly one of the worst meals I've ever had from a restaurant that I always loved.  Mialino, where have you gone?  And Service Manager, Timothy McKevitt should be ashamed of himself too.  You might have made a bad meal a little bit better."
-1,"Totally disappointed.  don't know what all the crowds and hype is for.  Service inept, and food was small portioned, signature pork was dry, clams and spaghetti tasteless.  Danny Myer should be ashamed"
-1,"Maialino also deleted my original post!!  Accept your fate of a 2 star average and stop deleting posts.  It will be my life's goal to bring the average star rating of this restaurant down. Update: deleted my second post when uploaded my review again.   ------ My original post is below: Oh Danny Meyer, if only you knew how horrible some of your wait staff is, you would totally fire their a$$es. I wanted to take my boyfriend out for a nice night after work, so I booked a spot here for Restaurant Week. Little did I know, they didn't have a Restaurant Week Dinner menu. Fine. I'll deal. Our waitress, Guiliana seemed promising at first... Stressing the AT FIRST. We waited 20 MIN until she took our orders. By then I realized she was derping when she scuffled over and squeaked that she ""didn't forget about us."" Ok lady, you were chatting up a storm to the 2 tables next to us. You totally forgot. Our appetizers didn't come out until 20-25 minutes later. The table who sat down before us already had their appetizer come out 10 minutes after we ordered. WUT. When the appetizers finally did come out, they were very underwhelming. The octopus was overcooked and the prosciutto di parma slices were so sad looking. PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA was sad. One of the most glorious cured meats and they managed to make it look sad. 40 MIN LATER... We got our entrees and they were both salty. The squid ink pasta was atrocious and my ox tail parpadelle was over salted. It was so salty that my tongue hurt. At this point, I was starving and ate it only out of necessity. Our waitress totally derped again when getting our check, meaning she didn't even get our check nor did she ask us why my boyfriend's meal was untouched. At this point, my boyfriend called over another waitress who called over the manager and had the horrible squid ink pasta taken off. It's such a shame cause you would think this place would be on par with everything: food, service, hospitality. But we felt rather unwelcomed. The place was filled with a waspy crowd and was very bourgeoise. Bleh. If you're looking for wonderful Italian, go to Osteria Morini. That place has HANDMADE PASTA. Maialino has DRY PASTA. WTF, for the price you're paying, I'd expect freshly made pasta. As Gordon Ramsay would say, ""Wow, what a shame."""
-1,"Wonderful italian food! Not the best, but definitely up there on my scaling. Delicious and tasteful. Check it out!"
-1,"Great food, excelent service, lots of character. I'll go back when I can."
-1,"Yummy brunch.  Nice pastries.  Service is meh.  Still, I would recommend giving it a shot."
-1,"Excellent service, good food. Carbonara was wonderful. I hear brunch is excellent at the hotel."
-1,"Enjoyed having brunch here, wait staff very efficient and helpful, food excellent. A little heavy on the pork choices, would have liked more protein variety. Had the pancakes with ricotta cheese, which was excellent. Nice friendly restaurant, would recommend it as a place to go with friends and family!"
-1,This place is amazing!!! The cacio e pepe & the suckling pig made my tastebuds dance with joy! Service was great as well. We'll definitely return for another meal.
-1,Wonderful staff.  Perfection in its pasta.  The only thing I dislike about Maialino is that it's difficult to get in without significant advanced planning.  Sigh ... I suppose one can't have it all.
-1,"One of the best meals I have ever had, course after course.  Highly recommended and a beautiful ambiance!"
-1,"My husband and I visited the wine room at Maialino for our anniversary dinner this past weekend. The Sous Chef Jason made a meal accommodating a few of our requests and our server, Amanda, was friendly and very passionate about the food. Out of all of the courses, I loved the homemade pasta course with ricotta and pecorino. Wonderfully spicy kick, but not overwhelming. My husband's favorite was probably the lamb - I'm kind of surprised he didn't eat the bone. The wine room was definitely worth it for a special occasion!"
-1,"Maialino has overtaken Lupa as my favorite Italian restaurant in Manhattan.  A friend and I grabbed dinner here on a Thursday night.  First tip...ask your server for the bar menu prior ordering.  There are some great starters there that are not on the regular menu. Started out with the Salumi Misti and the octopus appetizer.  Delicious.  Followed up with the Bavette in Guazzetto, which was outstanding.  Very unique flavor and a bit of heat.  Also sampled my friend's Fettucine Bolognese, which was terrific.  The fried zucchini and vinegar is also a must have (not what we expected, almost like zucchini chips).   For wine, check out the Shiava (SCHIAVA, HUCK AM BACH, CANTINA SANTA MAGDALENA).  Very light with a bit of spice.  Perfect with the pastas. Definitely headed back here again..."
-1,"Amazing service, amazing food."
-1,"a Danny Meyer creation. Needless to say, the food, the wine, the service, the atmoshere are all perfect. Facing Gramercy Park, this place is a must visit."
-1,"Wow.  My friend and I made reservations for dinner here for one of our two nights in NYC last week.  We read about it in Zagat and could only get the 5:30 p.m. reservation (always a good sign).  We made plans to go before we saw a Broadway show.   From the arrival, the restaurant has a very warm and friendly feeling - almost like you are walking into your mom's kitchen (not really what I expected being connected to the Grammercy Park hotel).  The hostess greeted us immediately and our coat's were quickly checked in the coat room.   I loved the seating in the dining room - very open and again, warm and inviting but not too noisy (yes, there were others dining at 5:30-7 pm).  The food and wine list is so amazing, we did not know where to start - thankfully our server made great recommendations.  I started with the Insalata Misticanza (my favorite) and it did not dissapoint.  My friend had the Prosciutto e Mozzarella as her first course and it was delicious.  For my main course, I had the Agnolotti di Zucca and it was incredible.  The flavor and texture were just right; I savored every bite. Note: the portions are just right and perfect for sharing.  I would recommend ordering 2-3 courses/person. Our experience at Maialino was excellent and I would highly recommend it."
-1,"I never write reviews but HAVE to write one of Maialino which is my favorite no.1 place since its opening - the food is simply amazing (lasagna is just like in Italy, actually it is even better!) and Isaac at the bar is one of the reasons I keep going back...he is delightful and service is first class!"
-1,"I found the sandwiches to be amazingly small and overpriced. Our waitress was condescending, bordering on rude. Disappointing experience."
-1,Really good food and desserts. You don't have a specific waiter and they are very attentive so we were constantly getting our water refilled without having to ask and getting checked on which was great. Small space so it's a bit crowded. Was able to hear the entire conversation of the people sitting next to me.
-1,the best coffee. there's just something about it!!! so delicious. I also love their jam filled croissants!
-1,"Love...love...love this place! Right near my house and has great coffee. No need for a shot of espresso here, the coffee is super strong and full of flavor. Plus the chocolate croissants are amazing. Only problem is they run out of the chocolate croissants often and you might get stuck with a wheat with raspberry...which is not nearly as heavenly."
-1,although this place is uber expensive...the 2$ coffee is WORTH IT. Check it out!
-1,"Food was yummy  ! Very tasty . I ordered the plantains with a spice that tasted like curry  with coconut rice .  Everyone at the table was happy with their food.. It was quiet when I got there but a couple tables filled in as the night progressed. Only complaint , as much as the food is good .. I felt like it was very pricey ."
-1,"Came here to meet a friend for dinner. At 6pm, we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. The atmosphere and setting are really nice. We both got the 3-course prix fixe and it was a wonderful meal, finished off with papaya sorbet and vanilla custard."
-1,definitley recommended..
-1,"This past Saturday, July 12th, I threw a surprise bridal shower for my daughter.  I wanted to keep within the 25-30 people guest list and ended up with 23 people in total. It was too perfect for words!  My daughter was totally surprised and my guests enjoyed themselves immensely! From the beginning, I worked with Gonzalo and as all the other reviewers mentioned, he was/is on top of his game.  I emailed him with questions and he got right back to me.  It was such a pleasure not to have to worry about this part of the event.  It's stressful enough worrying about everything else. My sisters, nieces and I arrived 20 min before the party and was allowed access immediately.  We decorated with our own flowers, a pom-pom/lantern bridal hanging and set up our shower games paraphernalia where we wanted.  Gonzalo served us mimosas right off the bat.  It didn't need much decorating.  The space is warm and inviting and we had plenty of room to mingle, sit and enjoy. I opted for the full brunch service.  I chose the slow heritage pork, braised chicken and shrimp & grits.  Everyone loved the food and it really was so delicious.  The staff was attentive without being obtrusive.  Gonzalo was always nearby in case anything was needed. My daughter was so happy.  I don't think I could have asked for more so I thank Gonzalo, the staff and all of Palo Santo.  I highly recommend it and will be visiting again soon!"
-1,"My parents threw me a baby shower at Palo Santo back in April and it was a wonderful event and an all around great day!   I worked w Gonzalo the manager to set up a lot of the details as my parents live outside of NYC.  He was very accommodating and helpful throughout the entire process.  It was a pleasure working on the details of the shower with him. The staff was extremely accommodating and nice!  The food was wonderful and plenty.   Our guests loved all of the courses and options and thought everything served was delicious. The vibe was relaxed and comfortable even when we ran a little over on our time.  The staff was great about it and did not rush us out.   I highly recommend throwing a party at PS! Between the amazing food and friendly staff you can not go wrong!   My parents and I were very happy with the shower and could not have asked for a better experience!   Likewise, almost every friend and family member that attended told me it was by far the best shower they had ever been to and that the food and drinks were delicious!"
-1,"Everything was unbelievable! The food was delicious. The staff was so attentive and went above and beyond to get us ANYTHING we needed. The chef, Jacques Gautier, came out of the kitchen a few times just to make sure we were happy. Who does that on a saturday evening when you have a packed restaurant!!!! The place is intimate, the location is accessible and convenient. I can't say enough good things about this place. ALL of my guest were so happy!!"
-1,"Whether it's a casual dinner for two, entertaining out of town food lovers, or the magical night created for my wedding, Palo Santo has always delivered beyond my expectations.   The seasonal, thoughtful menu is impeccably executed from it's most complex dishes to surprisingly simple ones.  My mouth still waters remembering a peach and red onion salad from this past summer. The setting is equally charming and artistic.  Salvaged treasures abound, there's stunning iron work, a working fireplace (!) and in the way back, a mini-oasis of a garden with one small table and one large fountain. But food and setting only succeed with a good staff.  The owner Jacques ensures that everyone he hires is warm and helpful and happy to be there.  As a freelancer myself, I was super impressed when I found out his employees receive paid sick days.  (quote from his Director of Operations: ""We see [paid sick days] as part of our larger mission of sustainability. We're going to contribute to a better Brooklyn and a better New York City."") Gonzalo, the event planner, was flawless.  Don't be misled by his youth and easygoing sweetness.  He is meticulous in every detail.  He is a great listener and accommodated every need imaginable from a Father-of-the-Bride with diabetes, to gluten free siblings and friends, vegetarians and teetotalers (not to mention voracious carnivores and winos!) We had a very non-traditional approach to our wedding and hated the waste of fresh cut flowers.  They suggested potted herbs.  Some guests took them home and the rest were donated to a local Public School garden Palo Santo has contributed to in the past. I could go on and on but the bottom line is: beautiful place, excellent food, wonderful staff and great for any occasion."
-1,"Palo Santo is nestled quietly between two brownstones -  my boyfriend and I walked right past it, but you just need to look for the metal cut out between the brownstones.  Inside is very cute and cozy, almost like a Rainforest Cafe for adults (less theatrics).  Perfect for our date night, but I also saw some groups come in and out so clearly they can accommodate. Our server had a nice and cheery disposition and helped us with ordering our dinner.  We got the corn on the cob as an appetizer, which was so delicious and unexpectedly spicy.  It came dipped in an aioli sauce, which I literally mopped up with the remains of my cobb...a cleaner alternative than actually licking the plate, which I would have done if necessary... I ordered the skirt steak and while I asked for medium rare, it came chewier than I usually like.  Otherwise, the portions on this dish were HUGE!  In my starved state, I managed to eat everything like it was my last meal; even our server was WOW'ed by how much we ate.  Food was very flavorful & fresh -  I'd definitely recommend it.  I've also heard that they have a rooftop garden where they grow their tomatoes to serve.   If the restaurant isn't too crowded, it's also worth it to check out the whole restaurant (we were situated in the front and didn't get a look in the back).  This place is filled with quaint details, especially in the backyard, where there is a relatively private area to dine."
-1,"When searching for a delicious, affordable and charming bridal shower brunch location for 15 people, I stumbled upon Palo Santo - and could not have been happier with the result! Service: Leading up to the Saturday brunch, the staff (particularly Gonzalo) were so responsive and helpful in getting everything ready in time and checking in with us. During the actual event, the staff were attentive and even set up a folding table for the gifts. Food: Far and away the best part about Palo Santo is the INCREDIBLE food. We had three main course options: papusas, french toast, and the tortilla cubanas - and each was more delicious and unique than the next. For sides we had a salad and plantains - equally delicious. Everyone in our group raved about the food.  The coffee, fresh squeezed OJ, sangria, and mimosas topped it off. Atmosphere: Palo Santo is one of the more charming locations I have ever been to. In the first floor of a brownstone, there is plenty of natural light and you feel like you are in your own dining room (albeit a much nicer version). We had a long table in the back area and despite their being other customers in the back section, it still felt intimate. Price: As someone who spent a lot of time looking for bridal shower brunch locations, a fixed brunch at $25 per person with unlimited drinks and a three hour time window is a rarity. You really can't beat the brunch prices at Palo Santo. It is one of the only places I have been to where you feel like you get MORE than you pay for. For a bridal party on a budget, this was key. And the experience was one the bride and her loved ones will always remember!"
-1,"LOVED this place... Had a wedding brunch here with a big family in the back room. Food was delicious-- we all filled up on the first course and were thrilled to find out there were two more!! Creative and tasty drinks, charming setting, friendly staff, reasonable prices, and creative and delicious food. Does it get any better? Can't wait to come here for a regular night out again soon."
-1,"A gem of a place. A very unique choice of ingredients, a small menu that focuses on the essential, the right combination of savors and textures, nothing is left to chance, it is a feast for the palate. A must try in Park Slope, there's nothing like it."
-1,"Palo Santo recently hosted the most amazing birthday dinner for me and about 30 of my nearest and dearest friends. First, the back room, which was ours exclusively, is a gorgeous and warm space, particularly on a cold January night. There was plenty of room for all of us to mingle over wine before taking our seats for dinner. Speaking of wine, the chef/owner helped me pick out 2 delicious (and reasonably priced) bottles for the group - one red and one white - and we just counted up the bottles at the end of the night....couldn't be easier. Obviously, the main event was the food.  As Palo Santo is a market driven restaurant, the menu was not decided until the day of (love surprises, so that was fine). We had a three course prix fixe dinner (only $25!??!) that included the most wonderful, zesty and rich duck soup I've ever had in my life.  Other appetizers included flounder ceviche (tried this too - also delicious) and salad.  Entrees included a vegetarian mushroom dish (sorry veggies, I didn't get to try it, but it got rave reviews), an outrageous roasted cod with a white sweet potato and avocado salsa and rabbit in a mole sauce. Every dish was absolutely delicious, beautifully plated and came to the table piping hot - pretty amazing considering how big the group was. Service was warm and wonderful, as well. Following the dinner, many of my friends contacted me to let me know what a downright splendid time they had and how much they enjoyed the food. What more could I ask for? I have eaten at Palo Santo a number of times over the years and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious and interesting meal in Park Slope or for taking advantage of the back room for a private party.  You won't be disappointed."
-1,"Loved it.  The dinner prix fixe ($25) was a great value, as I left extremely full, but even à la carte, the prices are very reasonable for the high quality of food. The only weakness might've been with the appetizers -- I wasn't as excited by the options as I was for the entrees, but I think it may simply be a matter of description, rather than the food itself (the simple listing of ""avocado"" does not do the presentation justice). My entree (heritage pork) was divine.  Only complaint to be had was that the side salad/melange it came with was on some kind of bread/wheat-based product that was a bit too hard on the bottom to effectively cut into pieces.  But the flavors and presentation were spot on.  My friend got the plantain stew, which was rich, complex, and subtle in its flavor.  As someone who resists ordering the veg options, I'd reconsider my stance for the plantain stew. And I will certainly be coming back for more, including the tasting menu.  I'm a finicky eater, but this place was spot-on.  And for those of you into greener pursuits, it appears that a number of the greens come from the roof-top garden. Service was attentive and helpful, without being intrusive or distracting. I wish I had a bigger stomach and could've eaten two dinners in a row."
-1,"Absolutely fantastic. Friendly service and super-flavorful food... I could have eaten my weight in that hummus, man. They must put crack in it... Perfect in every way. The lamb kebob I ordered was so perfectly cooked and taste Delicious. My mouth is watering just remembering this meal. Well-done, y'all... I'll be back"
-1,"I'm very picky when it comes to eating out, but this place has great food and service. My favorite is gyro doner but every dish is fantastic. I highly recommend this restaurant."
-1,Best grilled fish
-1,"Excellent Thai food at a reasonable price! The pad see ew is excellent, as are the basil vegetables. Their lunch special is particularly awesome - an entree and appetizer for only $7.50 (pre-tax).  It's a quality/value combo that's hard to beat on the UES."
-1,"If you are coming here to try to get some work done BEWARE! The lighting is not very good at all. I felt like I was in the lower level/basement of one of those smaller grungy clubs in the LES. Towards the front of the shop the tables are soooo tightly packed next to one another, so that when you get up and walk around (to take a phone call or use the bathroom) you have to constantly maneuver around the tables so as to not knock a drink over or disturb another patron. What really irked me though was the barista's shitty attitude and lack of attention to customers. I stood in front of the register for about two minutes staring plainly at the cashier/server (who appeared to be the only person on staff) while he fiddled with a few things behind the counter and looked aimlessly at other patrons, before he acknowledged that I was there, trying to make a purchase. I am not looking for someone to hold the door open when I enter, and I am not even looking for a greeting, but at least have the decency to acknowledge your customers and take an order. To top it off, he seemed annoyed by the fact that I would dare buy something. In any case, unluckily for me I was just a few days removed from a wisdom tooth removal, so my teeth were understandably sore and very sensitive. I ordered the mint lemonade and asked him for no ice. He filled the 16 ounce cup a TINY BIT PAST halfway and stared at me very smugly as he handed me what amounted to a $3 drink (THREE DOLLAR DRINK) that would be done in two gulps. It was definitely far less than what you'd receive from a standard 12 ounce can. To top it off, later on when I asked him where the bathroom was he seemed annoyed by the question and mumbled an answer under his breath as he very coyly gestured to the general vicinity of the bathroom. Moreover there is one single occupant bathroom with no markings to indicate that it is a restroom. So after he directed me to the general vicinity he watched me as I foolishly paced back and forth in the back room looking for the restroom. Finally, I entered a door which looked like it led to some back room/kitchen area (which had SHADY written all over it) only to use a restroom with no soap or paper towels. Safe to say, I am not spending my money or my time over here any time soon! Like it or not, the customers contribute to the sustenance of your establishment when they come in and pay money for your services."
-1,This was my first time at this establishment and I honestly enjoyed it; the casual vibe made it easy to relax. This place is definitely small but that adds an extra touch of intimacy. I recommend the croissant french toast!! The only downside would be that they only accept cash but there is an atm in the restaurant.
-1,"I am hesitant to write this as I dread the day everyone finds out about this place, but I want them to stay around too so here goes! It's such a great and cozy spot with excellent coffee and food. And as of right now completely uncrowded and a great place to work. One thing though - they really need to fix the front door to make it easier to shut. Right now it's impossible."
-1,"I love the American Retro - this is the perfect neighborhood bar!  The staff is fabulous, and the easygoing atmosphere makes it a great place to catch up with old friends or make new ones.  This is also the best spot for  fueling up before (or after) shows at Terminal 5.  Plus, they throw a great party - Halloween was amazing.  I'm looking forward to many more good times at this new favorite!"
-1,"Everyday I go to Just Salad on 51st and Park  and pass Uncle Gussy's on the way.  The line is always at least 10 people deep.  Today while en route to Just Salad I decided to change course and try Uncle Gussys.  This was my first ever food truck experience.  I got the chicken over rice.  The chicken was all dark meat, very fatty and hard to chew.  I got grossed out after 1 bite.  I removed the chicken and just ate the rice with lettuce and tomato.  I will never go back to this food truck again.  The whole time while eating, I was thinking of what kind of food poisoning this meal is going to give me.  Not a good thought."
-1,"Nick and his brother are among the kindest, most courteous, and friendly proprietors of a food truck you will ever meet. Going to Gussy's Greek food truck even once a week is an absolute joy, and when Nick or his brother greet you, you feel like you're amongst friends. Order anything over the yellow rice, and you won't be disappointed. My favorite is the pork souvlaki, with the Greek-and-Mild sauce mix, over rice. Get a baklava dessert or two to go, for that lovely cinnamon, cardamom, ambrosia honey, and toasted walnut taste on a light, deliciously flaky filo crust, and the rest of your day will be amazing. 51st and Park almost every day. Be there if you want a FANTASTIC meal, served by a great team. Also to Jessica Y. who stated that the food got cold from a 5 minute walk, remember, April was a cold month this year, and it makes no sense if the food was aromatic while walking, but was served cold. The scent would not permeate through the bag into the open atmosphere of the city and reach your nostrils if it was cold. You either have a severe problem with your olfactory or taste senses, or you forgot a major detail that you waited 2 hours to open your lunch bag."
-1,"Definitely one of the best food trucks that I have had.  The main thing about food trucks is the price point, and then you are left thinking what kind of quality of food you could be getting for the price.   This is not your typical Chicken/Gyro Combo and rice truck/stand.  For $6 I got the Combo platter.  The chicken is not butchered like other street meat carts. The pieces of chicken were actually identifiable as chicken and not just scrap meat. You could taste the quality in the marinade as well. Next the judgement on the yogurt/cucumber sauce.  This is LEGIT sauce.  You can taste the freshness and quality of ingredients that went into making this sauce.  It's all about the tartness and the consistency that has me giving this place two thumbs up.  As with any sauce, it should not overpower or mask the flavor of the food, but provide and complimentary flavor enhancing profile to the main star of the show.  No complaints on the rice either.  This place is a must go."
-1,"Love Uncle Gussy's! Its my favorite truck. They best chicken and rice option there is and quite generous servings. Its priced right, and I always consistently good. I've been going for several years, but its seems as though the secret is out and the line has gotten longer and longer. Still one of the best options and I need to get my weekly fix!"
-1,"Been going here for a few years now.  Every time it's as good as the first.  This is authentic Greek cuisine, served by authentic Greeks from Astoria, Queens.  That's about as Greek as it gets!  Always get the lamb gyro with ""the works"" (lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, white and hot sauce), and it's always AMAZING!  Unlike some other food carts, the lamb is actually crispy and tastes like real meat.  Also, the guys are really fast and friendly and will remember you, as they have many regulars.  Great experience, great service, great food, A+++!! Opa!!!"
-1,"I eat out daily and if you are in Midtown Manhattan, it gets pricey. There are ways to beat the cost. The food carts are nice, but for a skinny guy, I eat a lot and always end up getting hungry later. So, I start looking around and I found Uncle Gussy's. Now Uncle Gussy's is far from where I work. It's atleast a mile, but the yelp reviews have convinced me that it's good, so I had to do it. One day, just on a whim I walked to 51st and Park where it's located. And then I see the line next to the blue truck. The line doesn't move as fast as in a McDonalds/subway, but it isn't slow either. I ordered rice platter with w. extra chicken, spicy and very little white sauce. I don't usually get white sauce, cuz on the carts, it's just another name for mayo. But to my surprise, the white sauce from these guys is good. No trace of mayo whatever, and I later learned that this is called tzatziki and is made of sour cream (or I wish greek yogurt). Awesome.... My meal was great. The rice is nothing special, but the meat was just right. It's dark chicken and if you want white meat, I think it's $2 extra. I like dark chicken myself so no problem for me. And the extra meat for a buck is a bargain. I paid 6$ in total, and was full. Didn't feel hungry at all later. I love this place. If it isn't so far, I would eat here every day."
-1,"I was looking forward to trying a Babaganoush Falafel sandwich. Some of my friends from the office walked over 10 blocks to find the Crisp truck - after walking in the smoldering hot weather and not finding the truck, they decided to go into the Crisp rest. on 40th St. From what they told me, they encountered a very unpleasant, uncooperative and dismissive employee by the name of Ian. He was  offensive and completely lacking customer service skills. They ordered crisps and falafel sandwiches, but Ian ended up giving them falafel burgers. When they brought it up to his attention, instead of apologizing for his mistake and rectifying the situation, he became very dismissive and argumentative. One of the workers there realized what was happening and wanted to re-do everything the right way, as initially ordered, however, Ian jumped in and aggressively stopped the process. Although shocked and very disappointed, my friends tried to calmly explain to him once again that it was his mistake and that he misunderstood the orders - he simply refused to listen to them. cumstomer satisfaction was clearly not on his priority list.. Needless to say, my friends are very unhappy with today's experience and so am I. They brought me back something I did not order, but what Ian decided to give me... a very small burger (instead of a falafel sandwich).. It had very little Babaganoush that one could barely even taste it and it was so small that I now have to go buy something else to eat - it was the size of a snack... Way to go, Ian!!! We will never again come to Crisp because of you. I hope you did your manager and Crisp owners very proud today.. Hungry and hugely disappointed"
-1,"This place is great. A perfect and tasty vegetarian eatery, one block over from where I used to work. It is a delight to go there whenever I pass through the neighborhood. The falafels are fantastic, and the reclosable packaging is very innovative, and makes for a good way of doing take-out. I would definitely go out of my way to take lunch here. They've got some wonderful and creative combinations."
-1,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE NO STARS I WOULD!!!  I live on Roosevelt Island and I just happen to be in the restaurant business.  On three separate occasions, YOU HAVE FAILED.  The last two were on deliveries.  You would think I would learn, but its the only place open late on the island.  I USUALLY ORDER FROM CHINA 1, but they were closed.  When I called to complain (Which I never do) they told me that the computers were down AND that the kitchen was closed.  YOU AS THE OWNERS SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!  I didn't even ask for my money back.  I just wanted my dinner as I haven't eaten in 5 hours.  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!  DO NOT GO TO OR ORDER FROM RIVERWALK BAR AND GRILL - MY name is JC and my email address (THAT""S RIGHT, LETS SEE IF THEY MAKE RIGHT) jcshurts@yahoo.com!!  I DARE YOU TO PUT THE HOSPITALITY BACK IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY!!!  I live at the octagon, so doing the right thing shouldn't be hard.  As a GM, consultant and 14 year veteran of this business, I can come train your staff if you would like.  BUT PLEASE GET YOUR SH%T TOGETHER OR LET SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO DO THE BUSINESS TAKE OVER THE SPACE. DO NOT GO TO OR ORDER FROM RIVERWALK BAR AND GRILL!                   ."
-1,"Sunday brunch at Balaboosta ended up being a total disappointment. The lamb burger was absolutely dry and tasteless. We had to send it back. The service was grumpy (even before we send bad burger back) and very unfriendly. Not something you would accept from Sunday brunch crew. The rest of the food was also quite average. I might try going there for dinner, but not again for brunch."
-1,"started off well enough, got sat right away, lovely table...and that's where the good review ends. sorry balaboosta. their green-horn waiter forgot half our tables wine...had to ask another waiter because ours had his blinders on. the apps and small plates came out waaaay too fast, and were luke warm...and bland. the skirt steaks were over spiced and over cooked as was my filet mignon. which was of course ordered medium rare, and came out medium......embarrasing... the desserts were also a let down, the mousse was obviously in the freezer and needed a pick axe to get through, and the pudding was less than appealing. the espresso was great, best part of the meal. we will not be back. now, if balaboosta is an honorable restaurant, they wont have this honest review taken down...again."
-1,"The four of us went there today for lunch. The ambience is very Mediterranean and mellow, we liked it. We had the Tunisian giabetta sandwich and enjoyed every bite! The Mediterranean salad trio was very good as well. The other couple had some lamb dishes and says it was great.. I would love to come back with the kids but it seems to tiny to fit a stroller in between the narrow lanes in between the tables. I would probably think the same for a wheel chair."
-1,A great experience. Partner has Coeliac Disease and they had no problems in meeting her dietary requirements. Service was terrific and food great. Highly recommended
-1,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday, and the food was delicious. Ordered the Organic green eggs with quinoa hash browns and they were amazing! The waiter recommended a middle eastern hot sauce instead of ketchup, and it was the perfect complement to the dish. Definitely recommend trying this place out!"
-1,"The food sucks and the concept is weak at best.  By the way the owner was a jerk,"
-1,"The food is mediocre for the price...the service is horrendous...The owner Paul  has lost many customers due to his rude, arrogant way of speaking to people..I know of at least 10 of us who will not go back, not so much because of the food but for being treated like an idiot ...the floor needs to be cleaned once in a while too!  I would hazard a guess they will not be in business for long if they don't listen to their customers."
-1,"The chicken strips are decent in size and taste but are more pricey than i would've liked. The fries are OK. The place is a little small, so if you're planning on going with a group, be prepared to be cramped."
-1,YUMM
-1,Delish take on simple cuisine. Place not much on the eye but food is worth it
-1,"Best Chicken Fingers I have had in the city and beyond. The ""gregarious"" owner and his cohorts are also some of the friendliest people - all about service and making you feel at home. Try the Chicken Parm fingers and the ""Vampire Killers""! The french fries are also DA BEST!"
-1,"Sticky's chicken is excellent -- especially the ""posh little nuggets"" as the nice lady who worked there described them.  She was right.  They were DELICIOUS.  The Wasabi Chicken Fingers were also quite good.  The time to get the food was a little longer than I'd hoped, but probably because it was being cooked to order.  It's a tradeoff worth making.  The fries were just OK.  Sauces for the Chicken Fingers were decent."
-1,"I love chicken fingers.   I have the palette of a 12 year old, i know.   Stickys hits the spot.   I have been coming here since it first opened, but never thought to write a review because I dont consider myself a foodie and I'm no Ernest Hemingway.  But, last night I had their new French Onion Chicken Finger and i was BLOWN away.   I was lucky enough to sit and chat with Jon, one of the owners, who is 1 of 2 owner dudes that are usually there to see how things are going and ask if their fingers are to your liking (which i find humbling and a plus in my book)... I also had the truffle fries, buffalo balsamic fingers, and the bada bing fingers  which are all standard on my weekly trips to the 'joint'.   I'm lucky enough to live down the street from here, but my waist is certainly unlucky.  :)   This place is amazing, open late, and the chicken fingers are the best in the city."
-1,"Delicious food, great location, awesome people."
-1,"I went to sticky's today and absolutely LOVED the food. The buffalo chicken fingers were the best i've ever had, and the bada bing was also incredible. they have so many great flavors to choose from, and a ton of homemade sauces to try as well. the staff there was so friendly, they even let us try a new recipe they had come up with! LOVE this place can't wait to go back!"
-1,"I went to Sticky's on a Saturday for lunch and now it is my new favorite spot! I plan on going back every Saturday. Every single chicken finger flavor (especially the bada bing and the buffalo balsamic) was amazing and the truffle fries were the best I've had anywhere. Not only was the food unreal, but the service was even better. The staff is really fun and cool and extremely accommodating. Everyone needs to go to Sticky's ASAP!!"
-1,"STICKY'S FINGER JOINT IS FABULOUS!! The food is GREATand DELICIOUS just as The CHEW states it is. I made a trip all the way from Elmont,NY (Long Island) to taste how GREAT these Chicken Fingers are. It is WORTH THE TRIP!! Please,Please think about an expansion to the Long Island area. Sticky's Finger Joint will indeed BE LOVED by LONG ISLAND. Just remember to invite Valerie Dorsey to your opening day in Long Island. I will surely be spreading the name STICKY'S FINGER JOINT through out the Metro New York, Nassau County and the World. LOVE STICKY'S  FINGER JOINT!!"
-1,"Just reading some of the reviews... for those only commenting about the 3 Days to Open show..... get a life! - Or just go there and try it yourself, but stop being a hater and give the kid some credit! You don't have to like Paul... but the fingers are amazing. I have been to Sticky's 3 times (delivery once) and each time I'm there, everyone is super nice, and super friendly. Sticky's has a certain vibe, and those not feeling the vibe are corny. If you're a real New Yorker you'll know what I mean! Go for the Wasabi finger or the Fiesta finger. They make the order fresh, so sometimes it takes a bit, so if you're gonna take out, just call a few minutes before u get there. Will be back (if I haven't already been there since writing this)"
-1,Read about it in NY mag and took my dad on Saturday. We had a sampler of like 6 diff chicken fingers and sauces. All were good; some were great. The good news is that I live within their deliver zone so that makes me quite happy.
-1,"I've eaten a lot of chicken fingers in my day and I must say these are the best. Good products, cooked deliciously, served by very nice people. Inside the restaurant it's very casual and run by a laid-back staff. They also deliver. Do yourself a favor & get some ASAP."
-1,"If you like chicken fingers, this place should be on your bucket's list. I'm somewhat into chicken fingers and this place has pushed me into the loyalist camp--I'm going back as soon as I'm in the area again. The chicken is served hot and crispy, so tender and the dipping sauces are off the wall. I got chocolate BBQ and thai peanut. I had the classic tenders, but my friend got the wasabi tenders which were also amazing. We shared sauces. He had tomato aioli and sunny mustard. With my meal (I had a three piece which was surprisingly filling), I also had a strawberry peach drink which was organic and only moderately sweetened. This drink was so tasty. They also have cane sweetened Mexican Coca Cola, which is the tits. Although the place is relatively small and the seating is minimal, this is a fetish joint. This place is going to change the chicken finger game forever. I highly recommend that you give it a shot if you're perusing the area."
-1,"I just bought a cheese pizza here, this is delicious but need to improve customer service."
-1,"The food was good (I had a choripan and eggplant dish, both excellent) My only problem is the the restaurant is so tiny, so crowded and so loud! We came for dinner on a Saturday night I was bumped in the back no fewer than ten times during dinner as dinners and servers alike tried to squeeze past, which made me feel more like I was in the subway than a place that has $20 entrees on the menu. The music was so loud that you pretty much had to yell, which means that the people sitting two inches away are also yelling.   So, if you like good food, and don't mind not hearing every word of what your date is saying, definitely the place for you."
-1,Food is good for the price. Place is clean and good service. Its a bit on the small side so you may have to wait for a table.
-1,"This small, cozy, cash only restaurant serves the best Pao de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread) and Moqueca (Stew with Shrimp). Great live music also!"
-1,"I went here for brunch for the first time after reading yelp reviews and I was not disappointed.  My friend and I ordered from the prix fixe menu which was only $15. I ordered the steak and eggs and a guava mimosa. From my past experiences, steak and eggs usually come with 1 dry piece of strip steak but at Beco, it is a filet and it is cooked just the way I like it, medium. The place was fairly small but we got there around noon and got seated right away. We also had an option of indoor or outdoor seating. It started to fill up about an hour after we got seated so the earlier you come for brunch the better. We will definitely be back."
-1,"I've been coming here since it opened, a year and a half now? And I have to say Beco has the most consistently good brunch I've had in a restaurant,  period. The proprietary blend Bloodies are a knockout (i know for a while they were using Stoli as the house Vodka I wonder if they still are) I started with the Empanadas last time I came in and it was delicious, lightly crisp and with a lot of that homemade chimichurri on them I was a ship being wheeled out to the pad. I usually get the steak and eggs (nice price @ 12) but this last time I got the choose your own fillings herb omelet and my girlfriend got the scone and eggs and that came with a lip smacking little dish of Portuguese sausage on the side - get it! My omelet was awesome and the portions were plentiful. Coffee - lynchpin of a brunch is a standout here - good and strong/cafe con leche style. On a side note this place has aged well it has a nicely comfortable broken in quality like a seasoned baseball mitt now. I wish I lived closer it's a great asset for any hood. Saúde!"
-1,"Beco is an unpretentious gem with a badass steak sandwich.  Cool vibe inside.  Nice waitstaff.   It is right next to McCarren Park, so makes a great stop for a beer or caiprinha after a game.  My girlfriend had the shrimp stew and loved it.   We will be back!"
-1,Pretty sure they have about a hundred different beers.  Ahhh memories.  I want to go there right now.
-1,Their beer selection is pretty awesome and the atmosphere is always cool
-1,magnificent!!!
-1,"Perhaps my fave spot...small, dark (yet candle lit), comfortable... great selection of beers on tap (and no im not talking about bud light) and a great wine selection (fyi they only serve beer and wine)/  great date place, great place to catch up with a couple of girlfriends and a fantastic place to end your night.  Always play a wonderful selection of tunes as well.  especially nice in the summer, spring, fall to sit on a weekdy afternoon outside on the bench and have a beer..."
-1,"When I entered the shop the inner was eye-catching. But the problem of this place is with the service. There are no clear lines for ordering and paying and customers are just randomly scattered in the shop waiting to get served. So when you think it's your turn to order, they ring up the person who is sitting at a table already eating their food. Oh, yeah--the food. It's decent, certainly not superb or inspiring in any way, but okay. Everything is pretty much pre-made. But the food that's just sitting there and served reheated upon request."
-1,"Tried twice to like this restaurant and it failed miserably both times and its all due to the service. This most recent time we came in, were greeted and the hostess said we would have a table in a few moments.  If we had known it was going to be 20 minutes we would have tried to get a drink but when we got tired of waiting for them to get us for the table and tried to get that drink, the bartenders were too concerned with their own conversation to give us the time of day (had their backs to the bar- big NO NO) Made it to the table eventually.  The waitress was very nice.  My husband works in the business so the kitchen sent out a bunch of extras to our table.  They could have been coursed out better but whatever, the food was all very very good.  In the middle of our courses my husband was still eating off one of the salad plates and the waitress came over and took away his share plate from under him- food was still on the fork!!!! BIG NO NO.  To top off the evening, the waitress came over, knocked the candle onto the floor spilling wax everywhere- on my purse, my husbands jacket, and his shoes.  Are you serious?  I would have appreciated someone offering to dry clean our items even if we would never have taken it but all we got was a pathetic ""Sorry"". Again, the food was awesome but I will never return because the service was so unbelieveably terrible."
-1,"Ambience amazingly shabby chic.  Sea carmel sundae - amazing.  ""Best turkey sandwich you'll ever have"" per the waitress - no by a long shot.  Dry and meh.  Be wary of your credit card charge - a friend and I show three charges totaling $200 for lunch and currently working with ABC to get it fixed.  All in all, a cozy restaurant but I wouldn't necessarily come here for the entrees."
-1,I like the avocado salad with sour cream here. This restaurant is generally upscale and organized.
-1,"Not what you would expect from the outside. Much bigger & more chique inside, but despite being large it was very very crowded when our group went on a Friday night. Waiters were a little 'hispter'ish' but did explain the food well, they were not so great on their knowledge of wines. I would recommend they take a crash course in pairings. Serving time was decent for how crowded it was (took out table of 6 about 20-25mins for starters to arrive). The food was delicious but in the $$$$ range. Budget for about $150 per person if you want a full dinner & drinks."
-1,I absolutely love ABC Kitchen. It's a farm to table restaurant and it's superb. The ricotta ravioli is perfection and the salted caramel sundae is to die for.
-1,"The food here is good to excellent.  Sometimes things are just good.  But sometimes they are really excellent.   This is a good place to get a light dinner. or a snack if you want something to tide you over until dinner.  It is pricy though and the portions are on the small side, so it might not be a good place to go if you're actually hungry. I highly recommend the seasonal toast. The carrot and avocado salad is delicious.   And the side vegetables are reliably good.   The ricotta ravioli is good, but nothing special and probably not worth the price.  Ditto for the cavatelli."
-1,ABC kitchen is huge with two different doors in which you can enter. It also backs onto a shop can't remember the name though.. During lunch time there can be a wait. They said to us the wait would be 45 mins but we waited on the bench and it was probably approx 20 mins. The interior is decked out really cool. We had an amazing veggie burger and salmon salad which was also great. Probably set us back around 70 with a drink or two. Good hidden secret off the Main hustle and bustle
-1,"4.5 Stars Really enjoyed my dinner here.  I took off 1/2 a star because of the long wait, but in the end, it was well worth it. ABC Kitchen is a great little place.  The bar is quite small, with only 5 stools.  The restaurant is open and airy.  Lots of white (tables, chairs, walls) with some deep browns from the wood beams.  Love the large windows in the front. We started off sharing the Chicken Liver Toast which was AMAZING.  The velvety smoothness of the chicken liver and the crispy, crunchy toast were great together. I ordered the Lobster and it was delicious.  It was served with a wonderful oregano, chili lemon vinaigrette which did not overpower the lobster. Seared Artic Char was really good. The Char was prepared perfectly and the roasted cauliflower and salsa verde complimented it perfectly. Sauteed Corn with Manchego, Jalapeno and Lime was the perfect side dish! We ended dinner with the Seasonal Doughnuts, which were served with a warm peanut sauce.  PERFECT! The service here is really good and I do love the atmosphere here. Give it a try!"
-1,Good water.
-1,absolutely amazing  one of my favorite !!!!!
-1,The best summer tomatoes I've had all season. The mushroom pizza was decadent yet nicely balanced by the earthiness of the mushrooms. Lunch and brunch are definitely the best times to come to ABC Kitchen. You get the most value for your money.
-1,"What an amazing experience! Great food, amazing atmosphere, outstanding service!!! We even saw David Schwimmer there! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because the Entree's were a little on the small size for the price. I would definitely recommend it and will be back! It's a must try!"
-1,Good food. Good atmosphere. All you need to bring is the good company.
-1,"Great vibe, awesome food and good wine list. Wait staff is hip and helpful. Food is slow to come out of the kitchen, but well worth the wait."
-1,"Really impressed. Excellent service, and perhaps the best chicken liver I have had in a long time. Crispy chicken entree was perfectly cooked."
-1,Amazing and creative dishes.  A little expensive but defintely worth the money
-1,This Is what I consider a delicious joint although it's expensive for what you get. The portions are small but flavorful and the experience is great! And I love the space organic and natural feel  to it..
-1,"The food was great.  We had a party of 20 and they took care of everything.  Not one order was wrong. Ruby was outstanding.  Amazing, above and beyond. Sunday Brunch, we will always come back. Being from Houston we were surprised that the gratuity was not already included on the bill. Loved it. Will be back. Thanks Ruby!!!"
-1,"I had an excellent experience at ABC Kitchen. I went with my sister and brother in law and we received excellent service as well. The ambiance was inviting and calming at the same time. There was one special for the night. A delicious combination of dry rubbed roasted acorn squash with garlic roasted maitake mushrooms on a pool of a goat cheese dressing. SO GOOD!! The squash was seasoned with chili, star anise, and maple syrup...so fresh. Next was the pear and apple salad. Another amazing dish...the apples were caramelized and super sweet. Loved the pecan vinaigrette. The cavatelli with broccoli rabe and sausage was so delicious. Shared that with my sister and my brother in law and they shared the black sea bass and goat cheese and spinach pizza. Everything was so delicious and inventive. The popcorn sundae was the perfect ending. ABSOLUTELY will go back again."
-1,"We had three appetizers, tuna sashimi, peach ricotta and tomato-strawberry-feta salad, they were out of this world! We were then treated to the best pizza we had ever had, and we know a thing or two about pizza having lived in Italy for a while. It was with mozarella, tomato, squash and probably zucchini flowers and an outstanding crust. And everything garden fresh quality. Lobster and black cod were also very delicious. For dessert, we indulged in the peach cobbler. All in all: It was an extraordinary dinner!"
-1,"Extremely cool atmosphere.  Excellent wait staff.  Walked in without a reservation, on a busy night, and they were able to find us a table immediately. Sat down to excellent service and a knowledgeable server who suggested exactly what we needed.  The signature cheeseburger was outstanding as was the scallops and the sides.   Super cool place and with super good food.  A must visit when in NYC."
-1,"Instantly felt at ease with the decor of this highly reputed restaurant...its an eclectic mix that works in a kind of blue jeans with Louboutin's kind of way. Relaxed service and vintage mismatching crockery follows the theme and so does the food..... Love the fine flavours of lighter dishes; the salads, the sea bass but there is bulk too if you want that...incredible fried chicken and one of the best hamburgers anywhere. This is a place to go in groups and have a great time but equally if you want a venue for a romantic date with atmosphere."
-1,The service and food here is amazing. I had the chicken salad and it was delicious. Love the cakes they have here as well. Came here with ten of my friends and they accommodated us accordingly. I'll definitely be back in the future.
-1,The restaurant's atmosphere was very lively to the point it was difficult to carry on any type of conversation. The decor was hip and attractively stylish. The menu was diverse although we felt tasted somewhat repetitive in flavor. It was a pleasant meal and I am confident we will return soon.
-1,"Excellent dinner. Waiter, Ken, was very knowledgeable and took great care of us. Were celebrating our anniv and when the chef learned this, he sent over a comp dessert. Every dish was outstanding but the Caramel Sundae was heavenly! Will definitely return."
-1,"Top of the line.  We were here for a family function, and my daughter requires a very restricted diet because of her Crohns.  On the fly, the staff put together one of the best meals I've ever seen for her.  The rest of us enjoyed the extensive array of entrees and main dishes."
-1,"Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, drinks...whatever I want, they have and its amazing. Jean, you are a brilliant chef and you can do no wrong. This concept is stellar, and as a huge fan of the store, I was so happy when they opened the eatery. Now I can shop and eat, and feel happy all day. The french toast is like nothing Ive ever experienced, the drinks are hit or miss but are fantastic if you get lucky, the donut is NOT worth $10 but the jam...oh the jam, i would give my right arm for the jam. It broke my heart when I had to move, because honestly ABC is what I miss most. Dont take it for granted. It may seem pretentious at times, but just go to eat the food, not the people...mmkay."

-1,"Although I have ony been once, I LOVE this place! The ambience is trendy and cool, but it is not overly loud and the servers are very attentive. The butternut squash with parmasian and pumpkin seeds, the beets with yogurt, the hamburger, and the pizza are all delicious. Both the chocolate cake with marshmallow icing and the ice cream sundae with salted caramel ice cream are unreal. I am not usually a fan of chcolate or ice cream, but I could not stop eating either. Plus, it is reletively inexpensive for some much food and drinks for New York City. I can't wait to go back!"
-1,"We went late night -- around ten -- without a reservation and the place was packed.  Fortunately, just as we arrived, two people were leaving he bar, so we sat down. What an enjoyable evening.  The bartender was a wonderful host and the drinks out of this world -- definitely try the Ginger Margarita! I abhor carrots -- I go to great strides not to let them in anything I have.  But when my friend's roasted carrot and advocado salad came out, I was implored to try it.  It was amazing.  I loved loved loved it! The dinner pizzas, perfect.  Just absolutely perfect! What a great place, and we were shocked at how affordable it was!"
-1,Awesome breakfast!  Pancakes were some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. Donuts and jam are a must have. Not the best coffee I've ever had though. Bonus points for having Stevia.  My wife had the turkey sandwich and says it is the best she ever had.
-1,"Unreal meal and service at ABC kitchen last night.  We were seated exactly that the time of our reservation, our waiter was very nice and speedy and our table was lovely.  We started with the calamari and the crab toast.  I can not say enough good things about the crab toast!! It was unreal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Make sure you squeeze the lemon on it because the flavors explode immediately.  It is one of the yummiest things I have ever eaten.  We then had the organic chicken and the black bass.  Both were unreal and had a really nice heat to them.  Perfectly seasoned and really enjoyable.  Finally for dessert we decided not to try the sundae and do something different...we went for the banana ice cream cake  and it too was unbelievable.  For $100 for the two of us the meal was a hit! Loved it and can't wait to return."
