0,"Got here about 5:30 and the place was pretty empty still - got really crowded at about 6:30, though.  Came here for my husband's birthday and it was a great choice.  I haven't had crawfish since my last trip to New Orleans in 2010 so I was so anxious to taste that old familiar flavor.  And The Boil delivered. We split the 1 pound of crawfish and 1 pound of shrimp combo with medium Boil Special sauce, and also 1 pound of king crab legs with mild sauce.  We got the mac & cheese appetizer and I'm glad we didn't get anything bigger because all of this is a LOT of food.  Everything was so good.  I do wish I ordered more potatoes or garlic bread for the sauce, it's delicious.  The medium sauce definitely had some spice to it, but not overwhelming. All in all, food was amazing, service was great and friendly, the Hurricane tasted like New Orleans and they have all kinds of Abita on tap!! Definitely coming back."
0,"Great! Friendly staff, very fresh and delicious sushi, at happy hour priced a mere 3 dollars a roll: cannot beat that! Will be back for sure"
0,"Delicious! I love this place, their triple pork brisket as awesome! Absolutely try it out!"
1,"A friend of mine recommended it to me when I was visiting NY and I must admit, it is damn good.  A word of caution: it comes out boiling hot so don't make the mistake of a putting a whole dumping in your mouth.  We ordered both types of dumping on the menu along with the onion pancake.  Everything was delicious. Just FYI...similar to other fine Chinese establishments I've been to, they will seat you wherever they find room (with other people)."
0,"Fantastic authentic place With a Warm ambience. And the food is so good, dont miss out on the date cake."
0,Amazing ramen and pork bun!  The octopus was okay and the shrimp app was good but the ramen soups and pork bun yum yum!
1,A chill venue that was full but not crowded. Good place to grab craft beers with some friends. I recommend the flight if your not really sure what your interested in. The pours are fairly small and aren't really full pints. We were blowing through the mason jars quickly racking up a nice bill because the drinks are not full pints.
1,"We went last night with a party of 11.  The food was ok, but for what we paid, I expected much better.  Three of us ordered the steak for the main course and all of us (3 steak-loving men) left half of it on the plate.  Mine was tough and lacking flavor - disappointing for a $42 steak. The bigger issue for me was how hard the ""sell"" was.  From the moment we sat, it felt like our server was hellbent on getting as big a check size out of us as possible.  I ordered a rye on ice.  The first words out of her mouth were ""the drink portion is 1.5oz.  Would you like to make that a double?""  This was after a long speak about how it's a place where sharing dishes is common - however, each person should be expected to order at least one item from the left side (appetizers) and one from the right (main courses) and that the main courses don't really come with sides, so if you want sides, order more appetizers. I was put off our server after the ""do you want to make that a double"" comment and cringed all night long, as every time a glass was finished, she was right on it with ""do you want another?""  She pushed hard for the kids to order from the non-alcoholic menu for $9-10 fruit juices. It's a very expensive place where the servers must have been trained to make sure they get you to spend.  Don't expect a nice, relaxing meal here.  If there's an opportunity to sell you something, they will take it.   Some specifics: - the carpaccio was quite good - the fries were a joke for what you paid - the raw fluke was also quite good - a couple orders of the bone marrow were met with ""it's only ok"" (I didn't try it) - duck shawerma was decent - my favorite thing was the bread - nice puffy orbs, warm and fresh"
1,"When I went to New York, my friends said I had to have a real New York Brunch. As we pondered the vast array of options for New York brunch spots, someone said ""Tartine!"" It was unbelievable.  Now I understand why New Yorkers walk so fast, it's because they have so much energy from their fantastic breakfasts.  We were seated rather promptly and near their homage to desserts and as we waited to order all we could look at were the pastries, in particular the macaroons that were shaped like ""boobies"".  I am not sure how we could have left without taking one with us.  We had a fantastic time and it is definitely a worthwhile place to go while visiting the city!"
1,Finally got around to stopping by the Brooklyn Beet Company and I'm happy I did. My aunt and I went here for brunch after wandering 3rd avenue and enjoying the long overdue warm weather. The restaurant is small and relies on communal seating to get the most out of the tiny space. We missed the morning brunch crowd and were finished before the dinner crowd hit so we had plenty of table space. The brunch menu was filled with lots of tempting items and I finally settled on the beer battered cod. The cod itself was ok. I wish the batter had been a bit crisper. The stand out of the dish was the potato chips dunked in beet ketchup and the side salad of greens. The salad was amazing and highlighted the restaurant's farm-to-table ethos.If I had to do it all over again I would have probably choosen the Beet Salad dish. My aunt had the pancakes which she said had great flavor but were a bit heavy. I also ordered their Ottomobile cocktail which I am still thinking about. It was light and refereshing with a subtle licorice flavor. Not something I would normally like but it was cocktail perfection and I am trying to figure out how to recreate it at home.   The staff was friendly without being overbearing. A lot is made of their beet ketchup. I love beets and surely enough loved their beet based ketchup. It has a really earthy rich beet flavor with the consistency of ketchup. I'd definitely like to come back and try their dinner menu. And order another Ottomobile or three - hey it's for research!
0,"Love , Love this place!! The corn to die for , ( mayo, cheese, spices ,lime) what more can you ask for . I also love tostones (with garlic dip)  and maduros . Cute place too , love the bar and their homemade lemonade!! xo"
1,Great brunch spot for good atmosphere and good food. Some of the savory dishes can be a bit heavy so beware. Expect to wait an hour if you don't get there right before opening.
0,"Le Parisien is what NYC was missing. An authentic french bistro. Period. The atmosphere is real (Christian, the owner, professional and friendly,  was born in Paris, and has worked in the best restaurants in NY for 20 years), the food is to die for and very affordable (classic dishes like escargots, frisee lardon poached egg, pate, soupe du jour, steak frites (home-made), confit de canard, etc... as well as creative dishes like a cod fish with mashed potatoes and black olives, skate with pumpkin risotto, moules frites with saffron, etc...). As far as the wines, you can either order a glass (10 different options), carafe or bottle. As a french native, i hardly recommend this new restaurant (opened last july and already packed). Also, great date place because it's cosy, and the music is very low, so you can talk ! Also, the $11.95 brunch is worth a cab ride if you don't live midtown. Bon appetit !"
1,"Consistently fresh food with attentive service. I would recommend the pastas. Great environment and neighborhood. Also a very versatile place - you can stop by with a friend after shopping for a hearty or light lunch, or have a more upscale feeling dinner. All around highly recommended.  Authentic food - no chicken parm on this menu!"
1,"I would love to eat the plantain chips and guacamole every day!  I can't imagine anything bad on the menu.  I tried the desayuno americano, reggaeton, and Hawaiian.  All delicious.  The arepas were amazing as well.  We really shouldn't have, but we topped off our meal with sancocho.  My only pouty face was the watermelon lemonade.  It tasted exactly like pink lemonade.  Oh well, didn't stop me from clearing off my plate."
0,"I agree with previous reviewers that the service here is only okay. However, the food is terrific and comes out shockingly fast (which is great if you're famished and can't be served fast enough, but not so good on those evenings you're hoping to relax and linger). I usually end up ordering the vegetarian meze sampler because it's so good; some of the meat dishes are tempting but overpriced. It's a good standby to have nearby."
0,"The food and service are excellent.  The 3 course brunch is a great value.  It's got very clean and modern vibe, but it is all about the food!"
1,This is soooo unhealthy but I can't help coming back
1,"Pros: Service was friendly enough. Party of 2 Immediately seated on a Sat at 6pm. Food  (catfish po'boy, and catfish platter) were great, tasted fresh. Fries were good. Good thematic. decorations. Good sized portions. Cons: Slow service. Seemed a bit overpriced. Not enough variety on the dessert side  (Bread pudding, chocolate bread pudding, popcorn pudding, banana pudding, pineapple upsidedown something-- what are we in a nursing home?) None of these deserts sounded appealing to me. Limited menu, bad excuse for ""southern food."" Despite it's shortcomings I would give this SugarFreak another try."
0,This is awesomely awesome. The schawarma is amazing and so is the falafel. The greatest thing about this place is the ambience. Its awesome. Its al fresco. And I got a new hat!!
1,"Good wine selection, great crepes (from the place next door?), and the bartender lets you sit for hours without giving you an attitude. Now, the main reason I gave it 5 stars -- like a jerk, I lost my wallet that night. When I called 3+ hours later to see if it was there, I was told that it was, but didn't hold out any hope that the credit cards, much less the cash, would still be intact. Much to my surprise, everything was there. To complete the cycle of good karma, I now recommend Shade to everyone. ;-)"
1,"OK, I paid a lot but I enjoyed the idea of food we had for hours later. Amazing, simple and so good and the atmosphere - Great. Location makes it even more worth it. Places like this make Lower East side my favorite destination. Try lamb and swordfish!!! Heaven!"
0,"Came here with a bunch of my friends for my birthday dinner.  The food was incredible (highly recommend the veal parm), atmosphere great, awesome location and excellent service.  We had a great time and even stayed after we finished dinner to order an extra couple bottles of wine.  Great place to go to with a large group as their family style portions are ideal!"
1,"I was excited to try this place out, since the one in the OC was so good!  However, this burger was a bit saltier and greasier than I would've liked.  The ambiance is just like a bar, too. Well, I do like the ""U"" branded on the bun, as well as the crispy parmesan cheese!"
1,So I went to wheated last night food was excellent. Pizza makers were amazing made some of the best pizzas I ever had ! Waitress was very attentive and very professional. The place look awesome they had very cool animal head decorations. I only wish they where playing better music. It's Friday night ! They need some lively music not sleeping music ! But over all great place !
0,"As a person grown up to love noodles, I must say that they were pretty good. But  if you are a party of 3 or 5, forget it. The restaurant, designed for communal seating, only seats tables of 2 and 4 in a prompt and timely fashion. Any other seating arrangement you will be waiting for centuries. Even if a couple arrives way after you have, they will be in and out the door way before you are seated. We went knowing we had to wait, but after seeing couple after couple entering and exiting before we even got our chance i began questioning the hostesses method of wait times and seating. After kindly asking her why she was doing what she wAs doing, her rude , unprofessional and lack of consideration of customer service put ,e on the edge. To our experience even worse, we ended up with a greedy, selfish and inconsiderate waiter who believed that placing a bowl of noodles in front of you was fantastic service. Coming from the service industry myself, a tip is earned and reflects not ony your service, but the experience the restaurant gave. Well after we gave what we thought was an appropriate tip for our poor experience, our server complained about his tip. Saying that our poor experience at the front of the house had nothing to do with him and that he was a poor student trying to make a living and that he wasnt being paid enough by the restaurant. Well dear greedy server, Tip is earned not deserved - it's not only about you, but how the whole restaurant treats you You have the right to ask if there was something wrong with the service, not to ask for more money If you have an issue of being underpaid. That is a discussion between you and your manager, clearly someone is making money and it certainly isn't you If you aren't happy with your tip, then give it back. Sincerely A disappointed customer"
0,"My review has to be based on the bar alone and not food for I could barely understand the menu enough to order anything, so I didn't.   Welcome to the new Crown Heights Brooklyn.  Was semi-excited to see a new place replacing Roadhouse, until I went there.  The remodel looks great.  Can't say a bad word in those regards, but I'm not spending money at a place based on the looks.  The bar prices here are unreasonable.  I'm from Upstate and lived in Western NY for a long time.  We drink Labatt Blue/light out there regularly.  The minute I saw they had Labatt Blue I was excited because I can't find it at a bar anywhere here.  Then I noticed the price:  $4 a can.  If you take anything away from my review Know that you can get a 12 pack at Target at Atlantic Terminal for around $10. So since the beer is overly priced I opted to try one of the cocktails.  I chose the Planters Punch or something like that.  I figured it would be on the rocks in a rocks glass because that's the way the description made it sound.  Ordered my drink and watched over the bartender to see how it was made.  Skimpy pour for a $12 drink with lots of simple syrup and lime juice.  To top it off he pours it over ice in a tall glass and fills it with soda water.  That wasn't in the description and really got to me.  So I am handed my drink with no straw (not sure if it is supposed to have one or not) which isn't a problem except for all the booze is at the bottom so I have to suck down a bunch of gross soda water to get tiny amount of booze that I paid for.  Needless to say the GF and I finished up our drinks and made a hasty retreat. Sorry for the long review, just couldn't justify throwing out a 1 star rating without letting readers know why.  This place will do well in the neighborhood.  It's exactly what is becoming the norm.  It's just not for me. P.S.- sorry to JR for insulting this ""ground breaking"" establishment.  Pretty sure I can go to Williamsburg and find one on every corner.  I never bashed this place.  Just gave my honest opinion and experience there.  If you are cool with getting taken to the cleaners for drinks and food go for it man.  As I left off with originally, It's just not for me."
0,"Truly, I am not a pizza fan ,but this one really push me to recommend to you guys ,definitely must go ! PS : Be careful your check , the restaurant already plus 5$service fee included ,which I really didn't know .(I planed give them same amount for tip) lucky ,my girl found it ,other wise it would be 10$for tips."
1,"a friend of mine took me here for brunch. all i have to say is OMG. the mac and cheese is just off the chain....meaning, i have craved that mac and cheese since I left NYC four months ago. it is simply amazing. Kudos to naming each of their dishes after prominent leaders, but my heroes during my visit were the Gregory & Gloria Page (waffles with blueberries). Some of the best waffles, corn bread and mac and cheese I have ever had. Its the kind of heroism that only food can provide. yum."
1,"I can not give this place 5 stars yet since I have not ate there yet, but I must say that the beer selection is great on tap and the decor is rad! I went here to meet an old boss for a drink after class and was extremely impressed with the bars atmosphere. This place was really chill and it's more so for a young crowd I gathered. A bad had just finished playing when I got there and from what I heard it was some chill rock and roll, not bad. I'm looking forward to going back."
1,"Wonderfully delicious banh mi! This Vietnamese sandwich is so tasty that we devoured the sandwiches in less than 5 minutes! The store closes at 7, we walked in at 6:56 and the owner still took our order. The pork was marinated so well that it paired perfectly with the crunchy vegetables. They even toast the buns for you! Oh and all of this for less than $5!!! Must try!"
0,"It was Wednesday night during the blizzard of 2010.  I figured if I was ever going to try Di Fara without having to wait in line this would be the night.  So I hopped on the Q train from Union Square and sat an interminable amount of time (""the train is delayed, please be patient- at least 20 times!) and finally got off at Avenue J.  Sure enough, there were a few people hanging around, but I could walk right up and order 2 pies (there were 5 of us) and get enough chairs for most of us to sit down. The place is UGLY dirty- grime everywhere.  You just have to be OK with that if you're going to eat from the god Domenico at the temple of Pizza Heaven. Thankfully, they have paper plates and napkins.  But you also have to be OK with no bathrooms- even after a 45 minute subway ride (not cool!).   The oven is super fast (we got our pizzas in 10 minutes) and out comes this molten beauty with fresh basil strewn across the top like a flower girl throwing petals down the aisle at a wedding.  I have to admit- I thought I was going to be disappointed- NOT SO!   Also, Domenico is not a god after all, unless the old guy I enjoyed chatting with is some sort of Avatar.  Worth the trip!"
1,"Come here after softball games at prospect park. Food is GREAT! Awesome atmosphere. Every time I go, I do get a mean vibe from bartender. She is very abrasive and unfriendly. Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is bartender. Is it so hard to crack a smile and extend a friendly greeting?"
0,great food and great sangria service just alittle slow
0,"Love it!!!  Great people, generous portions, very tasty food, great price!!!!"
0,Royale has a reputation of being a GOOD beer an' burgers joint and me & my buddies agree  . The food is good to great and the beer selection is good if a bit pricey. The people hanging out here are laid back casual and the wait staff more the friendly.
0,Great Sushi! Excellent service and the atmosphere is great. Definitely a place to check out if you want something tasty with great drinks!
0,"I love taking friends who are visiting the city to this spot. The area can be somewhat unsettling at night, but navigating the area is well worth it when you see the pleasant surprise on your friends' face as you take them down this small alleyway to stumble upon the quaint restaurant tucked away. It's also right across the street from a great beer garden called Loreley's that you can fall into afterward."
1,"I love Thai food. Sri Pra Phai is hands down is the best Thai restaurant in NY in terms of authenticity. I've traveled to Thailand last year and this restaurant is the only one that brings back the true taste of Thailand. When I get cravings, I would come here for the shredded green mango salad or the papaya salad, the soft shell crab served with green curry sauce, and the Tom-yum shrimp soup. I would also recommend the green curry roasted duck(yes! green curry! It's more spicy than the red curry but it's much more flavorful), crispy Chinese watercress salad, and fried fish cakes. It's absolutely to die for!!! The only thing I have to complain about is their service. I think it's because they have so many customers that they don't even try anymore. I come here once a month for almost a year now and not once have I received great customer service. They're usually more busy on the weekends so that makes it even worse. It's best to come during lunch time or during the weekdays."
0,The best restaurant in the whole town and meal of that restaurant is very tasty and have high quality food so i am so glad and happy after the lunch.
0,simple amazing pizza. This is a first time I didn't have to wait to get in I am happy about it. food is great next to Brooklyn Bridge. We had a great time
1,"I went to Stone Park Cafe for dinner, not brunch, which is what everybody raves about. The food was delicious, and the ambiance very quaint and cozy. The portions were not that large, and the prices a bit steep. Luckily for us we were a bunch of girls, had my boyfriend come this place hungry, I defiantly think he would have left quite hungry. Overall, a great experience, although I doubt I'll be back, for dinner anyway!"
1,"I'm a shabu snob. I won't hide that fact. Shabu-Tatsu has fairly decent meat, bordering on the higher quality side. No AYCE (Yes, I'm a fattycakes that loves AYCE shabu because I can eat for hours) but they charge by plate. Liked that they offer a variety of other dishes on the menu. Along with all of our yummy meat, we decided to order calf liver sashimi and yukhwe (beef tartare) Isn't that Korean? Is this place Korean owned? I've had a fair amount of beef tartare in my life. Korean beef tartare? Been there, done that. While Shabu-Tatsu's wasn't anything impressive, the calf liver sashimi was definitely interesting. The calf liver sashimi comes beautifully sliced with a side of sesame oil, minced garlic, salt. I tried the liver sashimi in a small dab of sesame oil with a tiny bit of salt. Didn't like it that way. The sesame overpowered everything. The calf liver sashimi is a bit gamey (duh, it's liver) but it's crazy delicious with just a small sprinkling of salt, pepper and a tiny bit of the minced garlic. Service is pretty much impeccable. They came around periodically to skim the fat out of our broth and remembered to make the ""tea"" out of our broth at the end. So comforting and crazy yummy. Make a reservation though. The line and wait can be bananas."
1,"If you don't throw my quesadilla on the griddle after assembling it, then you've just given me a smaller, flatter burrito with no beans and rice."
1,"I was not a huge fan of the Beef Pho here. It was just too bland or watery for my tastes. I've tried better at many other places. Nonetheless, service was great, especially for Vietnamese cuisine. What got me was my friend's entree, whichever had the rice with beef cubes. I wanted to finish her entree rather than my Pho. I would not come back for Pho, but definitely to try the other entrees."
0,"An elegant brunch, a Sunday hot spot for creative, classic Jean Georges concoctions, courteous service, beautiful decor and an overall classy affair amongst fab West Village-rs. Would recommend the Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna and all items involving yuzu."
0,"On my second visit to Ponty, the food, ambience and service did not disappoint me. The steak was tender, juice and tasty. This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC."
1,"4.5 stars.. almost gets a 5. My Astoria residing Cousin took me here in preference to to my usual. We turned up late but still had to wait in line for about 30 minutes.  But the wait was certainly worth it. Try the grilled octopus... it's the best I've ever tasted anywhere in the world and that includes harbour tavernas in Greece. It was tender and delicious and I could live on this alone! We also shared a whole grilled Tilapia with crispy skin and succulent flesh all soaked in plenty of lemon wedges. Whole fish are priced by the market and this easily shareable fish ended up being around $25 which was a good price compared with recent trips to other fish restaurants. We also tried the sword fish kebab which is huge! Large chunks of sword fish grilled and served with peppers and onion.. delicious. All the fish was expertly grilled. We also ordered Greek salad which is traditional.. ie with a big slab of feta on top of tomatoes, onions cucumbers soaked in a vinegarette. This was the most authentic Greek meal I've had outside of Greece to date. It was all excellent. Why the half star knocked off... service is a little brusque (they are so busy that serving the restaurant does not look like easy work!), and the wait time which admittedly really isn't their fault. Highly recommend to anyone.."
0,"The atmosphere is enough to go back again and again, and the menu items are appealing and very tasty. Their grilled pork chop  is something special-- simple ingredients that make it pure magic!  I'm just too busy shoveling the savory down my throat once I start! Fun casual place. Very good reasonably priced comfort food."
1,"Intimate space with outstanding, creative small plates. We had the chopped salad, brussels sprouts, trout with green onions, the pork belly, a cheeseburger, and the bone marrow tacos. Unique, delicious, with fresh and light preparation. We sat at the bar to skip the line--a perfect dinner!"
0,"I dont understand why people willing to wait so long for this place, the ramen is not that special, there are many many ramen spot in NYC are as better as Ippudo, and I cant believe I waited 2 hours for the table!!!"
1,"I don't get the hype! Everyone at my table ordered the black label burger and only one person could finish it. The burger was soooooooo salty. The fries were equally salty. I honestly could not tell the difference between this $26 burger and any other burger I've had. Actually I probably would have enjoyed something from 5guys, shake shack or in-and-out more. Only reason I am giving 3 stars is because we also split the crispy pork belly appetizer and that was really delicious! It came with tender peas and a nice tangy sauce that cut the fattiness of the pork belly. The drinks they had were also very good and strong. My favorite was the Tom Collins!"
1,"I don't get why this place is always an hour wait. Unlikely to go back. Nothing special. I'd say the food is a 3.5 stars-- taste ok, but price is a little unreasonable, ambience is 4, and the service was standard hipster style. Pass if there is a wait. Definitely not worth it."
0,"Can be hard to find, because there is no sign, except for a neon ""psychic"" marquee, and usually a woman sitting in the storefront window doing tarot in front a red curtain.  But walk on through the curtain and enter an extravagant bar and patio.  There's not really meals (think tapas), but the apetizers are exquisite.  The mixologists that own the bar take great pride in the selection of expensive cocktails, but I usually go for the scotch.  Pricey."
0,A very welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I love the following: Spicy Tuna roll (a meal in itself) Both soups (udon and ramen) Tuna Burger Kobe Burger Miso I go 2-3X/week.
0,"My wife, daughter and I visited the placefor dinner on Wednesday. We ordered three entrees: chicken and rice, stewed codfish, and beef stew. In addition, we ordered a bowl of tripe soup and mashed fried plantains. The tripe soup was delicious and the mashed fried plantains tasty. But, we all found our entrees less than perfect. Generally, the main dish was dry and tasteless and the rice and beans somewhat plain. We were generally disappointed and surmised that the entrees were not freshly cooked but sitting on a hotplate somewhere to be eaten by someone who happened to order that dish that night."
1,"Let's dig in: - I ordered the Havarti Egg Sandwich - 2 eggs, havarti cheese and tomato on thick sliced multi-grain bread, and a side of fries. - my friend Denny got the turkey burger with iceberg lettuce wrap, and a side of coleslaw. - my friend EC got the Big Blue Bacon - Danish blue, bourbon sautéed mushrooms, apple smoked onions, blackened maple bacon, lettuce and apple chutney (she choose the beef burger on a brioche bun). - We all shared the Fried Bread & Butter Pickle Chips - made with Bubbies bread and butter pickle chips, served with horseradish mayo. Okay, okay - so I didn't get a burger. But hey, that was a damn good egg sandwich. The pickle chips were awesome. And the nice crispy fries - well, what upped the ante were the three sauces that came with it: curry ketchup, spicy chipotle mayo and bareburger special sauce.  Yum, yum, and yum.   I really enjoyed eating here. This place has a nice relaxing vibe to it.  There's a good amount of seating, but it can get crowded when all the tables are filled up.  The wait staff were very nice and attentive.   See you soon Bareburger.  Real soon.  And next time, I'll have a burger. UPDATE as of July 2012: FYI - I did have a burger, and it was damn good! :)"
1,Had there massive toppings waffle with strawberries and chocolate sauce. Was just ok but I would try again at main location.
1,"Apparently it's one of the best shabu shabu places in NYC...but it was just OK for me.  Their entree sets could have had more variety, and the prices didn't have to be that high.  We each paid about $35+.  Come on, I grew up eating this at home...$35 worth of meat can feed the entire fam.  I'll come back again, but it's not going to become my go-to restaurant for shabu shabu."
1,"I suggest when coming to carmines you do three things: 1.coming hungry 2. Come with a large group (preferably a pack of starving wolves) 3. Come with a stretcher (cause they will need to carry you after you eat). Carmines is definitely food coma central, oh, and they also have the best Italian food in town! All their dishes are served family style which is why it's wise to come with friends or family. You can come with two people but you should just get one dish then, there will be left overs. There's seriously not one thing I dislike on their menu everything is delicious. When we go our usual is the spaghetti with ragu sauce The sauce comes with all three meats such as their delish meatballs, pork bracciole, and sweet Italian sausage. Their appetizer platters are good too. I prefer the hot one over the cold. And I absolutely adore their ceasar salad! It's super yummy. IF you have room for dessert and that's a huge if, I would recommend the tiramisu. Really good and light! The overall place is a cheery family place. The staff is nice and well dressed. Without a doubt I will continue to come back. No better Italian food anywhere else. *the foccacia bread is addictive,  ask for more ;-)"
1,"This small shop on 2nd Ave. does nothing but Belgian style French fries. We ordered a regular size and split it ($4.50). While there are 26 sauces available for extra charge, such as Vietnamese pineapple mayo and Irish curry, we decided to have the traditional frites sauce, which is European mayo. The fries are double fried in the Belgian protocol and are random sizes and shapes. The edges are nicely browned with the body being golden and a fluffy interior. All in all an excellent fry, but not as good as many of the ones found in Brussels."
1,The Saag Paneer is out of this world and a must try!
0,"Super, delicious food cooked with love!  Lived in the neighborhood over 40 years!!! Discovered this ""hole in the wall"" gem about a year ago.  In the old days, ""normal"" people didn't venture to Amsterdam Ave."
1,"I love everything about Ladurée. Such an adorable and fancy little macaron shop. The presentation and packaging alone is very impressive. Be prepared for a crowd, but that's obviously because the macarons are that good. But stay away from the Rose Petal one."
1,"A great find!   The spicy lamb sausage and eggs with fries and a green salad was outstanding.  The staff was friendly, attentive, and played great music.   The atmosphere was charming, the room is very nicely done with a piano and fireplace in the back.  I would definitely recommend."
0,"We have been wanting to try this spot for a while and we expected it would be busy since its a sat. night but it was insanely busy. The hostess (who is hot by the way)  Maya  was so awesome and chill. She told us the wait was an hour but but would try to get us in sooner and put us on the wait list. We got a txt 20min later saying our table was ready which was perfect since our drinks just came. Her Host sat us but a few minutes later i found out we had 1 more person coming  even though they were packed as soon as i went and  told her (not thinking she could do much) she found a chair in like 2 seconds and twisted our table to somehow walla fit 5 of us. Love her!!!  Beer, Bacon, Bourbon!!!!! Our server Mike was was kool as well everything he recommended was on point! The Drinks here are Strong but no complaints!! Must Try Egg BLT and Bacon flight !!! The game was on multiple screens and the music was chill Over all we are already planning on our next weekend Bar  Bacon night!!!!!"
1,This was a great neighborhood choice before a Sunday evening show. My friend remembered having dined at a ramen place w a long long in the are and I found a couple by searching yelp. Line was formed despite 5pm hour. They took our order outside and seated us at the counter where we watched our food prepared. Tried the pork bun which was moist and delicious and dined on spicy chicken ramen w a cold sake. Loved everything.
0,"Definitely lives up to the hype. We had to order the pancakes, since the reviews on here are pretty much one giant ad for the pancakes. They were just as amazing as promised, somehow both crusty and fluffy. Just amazing. Our group also ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the croque madame and both were really great, particularly the pulled pork sandwich. It was fresh and filling and balanced out by a really delicious side salad that had some kind of light, acidic dressing on it. We split the dishes three ways and there was not a single bite left on any of the plates. This will absolutely be a new neighborhood standby. I'd say that I can't wait to try more on the menu, but honestly I'm just thinking about repeating that same meal..."
1,"This place is awesome. I went here for my birthday and it was recommended by a friend who works at Craft. The tasting menu was inexpensive (I think it was in the $50 range), and it was not overly complicated and just great. Plus a little treat at the end solidified the experience. One of the best places to check out and the wait staff was fantastic."
0,"This place is yummy!!! Super great brunch! All the food was amazing. Good service. They were very kind to bring me vinegar, lemon, honey and hot water for my sore throat. Our party ordered the apple gruyere omelette, spinach mushroom omelette, Benedict, and spinach goat cheese croissant. All were excellent. The fruit bowl side was also very nice. Crispy potatoes were perfect and the side salad fresh (ps. I really like East coast bunch serves a small salad with the entree; makes the meal so balanced and I feel healthier for it). Oh yeah, coffee so excellent I could drink it black. I'm curious to try Le Barricou for dinner, and I would probably return for brunch- more for the space and trip to Williamsburg, than for the food."
0,the perfect spot for ramen on a cold day. Excellent choices. I suggest adding an egg into whatever you're getting. Hot sauces available for anyone who needs it spicy. Vegetarian options are delicious as well. There will be a wait - it is worth it. Super casual environment.
1,"My knowledge of Chinese food is severely lacking compared to other cuisines.  My childhood is filled with memories of General Tso's, egg foo young and egg drop soups.   However, i've slowly been educated on the wonders of crispy braised duck, congee, soup dumplings and other more authentic Chinese cuisine since i've moved to New York.  The common thread of a lot the places that i've eaten at are overly greasy and overly salty food.  It's a wonder how my Chinese cohorts stay so thin, with a seemingly steady diet of grease and starch and not a green veg in sight. Compared to many of the Chinatown mainstays, Noodle Village is an oasis in a desert of grease and salt.  They pride themselves on less greasy, less salty and no MSG dishes, while preserving a degree of authenticity.  Not only are the dishes healthier, the atmosphere is less hectic, which is a big plus in my book.  While sitting at a table with random strangers, a normal Chinatown event, is novel; getting barked at by rude waiters is complete turn-off for me.  At Noodle Village, you get your own table, and the waiters are patient and accommodating.   Better service aside, the food delivers.  Hearty noodle dishes, tasty soup dumplings and chinese broccoli (with sauce on the side) are completely delicious and make for great hangover food. I'll still visit Big Wongs, and i'll continue to patronize Golden Unicorn for Dim Sum, but Noodle Village has quickly become my favorite place for Chinatown eats."
0,"I had heard good things and when I finally made it there to eat, I was not disappointed. My friend and I both chose to be surprised by the chef's tasting menu. I really liked the food selections and that they took into account our preferences. Service was great and the infused tequilas were interesting- I will be back to try again!"
1,"You know a restaurant is good when you dream about it. Getting there from downtown Brooklyn is a pain in the ass, but it's worth it. Having to run a gauntlet of surly MTA workers would still be worth it. An hour long wait on weekend nights to get a seat is worth it. Listening to little kids throw temper tantrums against all that is made out of breakable china is also worth it. The garlic barbecued pork appetizer is excellent, as are the crispy veggie spring rolls. But I come for the red curry. If you ask for it hot, you'll get it hot and spicy. Not pointlessly meanspirited, but the right kind of sting and burn that gives you that lovely Valium-esque afterglow. They also make a steamed banana tapioca mush dessert that is lovely. The service is a bit slow when they're busy, but who cares? Obviously lots of people care about service, as yelp and other ""consumer-driven content sites"" show, but those people are missing the point. Or perhaps I'm missing the point, coming to eat curry when I should have been desperately seeking fawning."
1,"I really liked this place. Fun, laid back, and yummy! The food was great! And not terribly overpriced. I would definitely go back! Service was good, too!"
1,SABICHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH oh my god eggplant and egg aren't paired nearly enough. this is the greatest sandwich ever and the employees are really cute. sometimes it takes longer than I am accustomed to waiting for falafel but it is completely worth it and a very pleasant interior. mmmmmmmmmmmm
1,"I went here on a Saturday at 8 PM for dinner with a buddy because it had good yelp reviews. Pros: Good Scotch selection, not too loud so we were able to have conversation, shepherd's pie was tasty. Cons: Pricey, server wasn't very engaging, more of a 40 something crowd."
1,"Chili lobster was surprisingly good. Chicken under a brick was disappointing given the hype. Chicken was cooked perfectly, decently crispy skin with veg medley drowning in drippings. But it's still just chicken. Should have ordered something else. Chicken portion was very generous (for 2 but didn't finish even half of it)"
0,"I wanted to go to an Italian restaurant in NYC and ended up going to Trattoria Trecolori.  It was definitely worth it. First of all, the service was excellent--the servers were always friendly and seemed to know what I wanted even before I told them!  The food was very good as well.  I had Calamari for appetizer and veggie bowtie pasta for my main course.  Both were delicious and reasonably priced.  Next time I'm in New York, I'll definitely visit this restaurant again!"
1,"salmon pie is good,avocado sandwich is good, waiters are friendly and helpful"
1,"A couple years back I visited Paris as part of a 3-week trip through the UK & Europe. One of my favorite things about this place, besides the fact that I was reminded of my homebase of Washington, DC, was the cafe culture! Everywhere you turned there was a quaint little cafe where patrons of all ages and walks of life would be sitting down sipping on a coffee, enjoying a baguette by itself or stuffed with something, or eating some other delicious dish. Well, at Petite Abeille, I was taken right back there. This cute little belgian brasserie in Flatiron is a perfect mix of old world French and Belgian influence, complete with murals of French comic strip ""Tin Tin"" on the ceilings, and blue and white bistro table cloths. The menu is one of those that's too hard to choose from: fantastic eggs benedict or fruit covered waffles? Omelettes or baguette w/ Nutella? Croque Monsieur or Madame?! All of them look so good... We settled on the Eggs Coquette (fried egg served overtop of bacon, goat cheese, and tomatoes, covered in gruyere and twice baked) and a deliciously crispy Croque Madame. Each came with a little salad and some ""stoemp,"" which I came to find out was Belgian for mashed potatoes with Leeks. Two coffees and a bowl of fresh fruit, and you've got yourself one hell of a brunch! If I lived in New York, I'd probably also return here very soon to try one of the 8 mussels dishes (beer & bacon stew? Yes please...) and 30+ belgian beers they have on tap. Whatever the meal you have here, you'll walk out proclaiming ""Vive la France!"""
0,"Delicious ingredients, some of the best sandwich bread around, great drinks, equally satisfying eating inside the shop upstairs or taking a freshly made sandwich to go... I just wish it were a bit cheaper. Grab extra napkins."
1,I went here with a friend of mine named Mark and thought it was convenient to eat here. We were in for a surprise. This place was amazing and the fries are the bomb!
0,"The food came quickly and was tasty, but the total lack of hospitality ruined the meal.  My husband and I went on a recent Friday evening and I met him at the bar. We were seated fairly quickly, however sat for 15 minutes waiting for a waiter, as a group of waiters hung out behind us near the bar seemingly just chatting.  We finally flagged down a waiter and asked if we could order. He told us that he was not our waiter.  I asked him to find our waiter since that person had not yet shown up and then he took our order.  The service after that point was fine, but I am never going back."
0,"Emporio has not taken time to create good dishes, the restaurant is very nice too look at, but at the end, it is food that really matters! I am recently arrived in New York from Italia and would have to say I would never eat here again. It is all trendy hipster-types, and very loud. And, serving such low-grades olive oil in an Italian restaurant is a very disgrace! One would be dragged out in the streets and shot for serving such a poor oil, at such an expensive restaurant, back home."
1,Delicious beer and quick service here at Sugarburg!  Great selection of craft beers in a  variety of brew types and all at a reasonable price point. The bartenders were awesome and attentive!
1,"Get to the Chase: Pros: 1) Have custards of the day 2) Not McD prices, but not Manhattan-standard prices iether: $30ish dollars for 2 sodas, 1 hotdog, fries, 1 burger 3) They sell dog food too...wierd Cons: 1) Wasn't impressed and still don't get why it's always packed. Burgers and fries are no better than any other burger. Nothing 2) The price isn't justified for what you get 3) Their milklshakes are extreeemely heavy with just dollops of ice cream and artificial flavoring Order of the day: Shake-cago Hotodg, Shack Stack, Fries, Draught Root Beer, Dr. Pepper, Shroom Burger"
0,"I have never done this before..... I purchased the food.... I took one bite, then I got up and left.   The pulled pork looked like a used and soiled diaper.... The pork belly was one large piece of fat, not even one whisp of meat....  The fried chicken bun was OK...edible but slightly tough......  I was so excited to hear about their opening because I live in the area and I love pork buns, but I will NEVER come back.....  I hope they can get their act together....."
1,"Great Cuban spot in the West Village.  It looks pretty small from the outside, but there's a decent sized room in the back, and more seating downstairs.  It was a beautiful night so they had all the windows in the front open, with a guy rolling cigars in the corner, and live music near the bar.  We started with mojitos which were a little watery the first round, but strong the second round.  As an appetizer we got the ham croquetas which was delicious.  As a main course my girlfriend had the ox tail and i had the vaca frita, both which came with rice and beans.  We both really enjoyed our entrees.  The ox tail was very tender and the garlic and lime in the vaca frita was great.  We also had fried plantains, which looked more like french fries, and came with a great dip.  I was very surprised with how good they were and definitely recommend ordering it.  The only problem with the place is the noise level, it was so loud.  There were points during the meal where it felt like we were yelling at each other, but it seems that a lot of cuban restaurants are like this."
1,Nice people and good portion good. Weekends are better to hung out.
1,"along with bait & tackle you have two real solid bars right next to each other.  this place is cheap looking but the atmosphere is solid.  its kind of like a black hole. i've been three times and every time i went in with the intention of one beer and maybe some wings, then stayed for hours.  just wished they'd mix up their drink specials, b/c i'm getting soooo sick of drinking PBRs everywhere haha"
0,"I have tried many Halal carts in NYC from Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens with the highest rating. I have to say, this place tops all of them. The meat and rice just compliment each other and is not blend like many other places that need their sauce to create taste (like 53rd in Manhattan). I certainly recommend!!"
0,"Came here for a quick bite while I was in the neighborhood with some time to kill... I ordered my two favorite things, French onion soup and creme brûlée. The French onion soup was just okay: a little wine heavy, and a bit weak flavor wise, and for some in fathomable reason they topped the cheese with cilantro and diced tomatoes (an unwelcome addition, but I picked it off without trouble). The creme brûlée though was absolutely incredible. It had a perfect sugar crust, with a delicate custard at the perfect temperature and consistency, and you could see the ground vanilla beans at the bottom of the ramikin. Sumptuous, well-balanced, attractive plating, great ingredients, and an attentive and traditional technique. I would go back twenty more times if only for that, but I would absolutely look further into the menu given the time. A must-have if you're in the neighborhood!"
0,Awesome!
1,"Solid pizza. The place was pretty packed for lunch and my wife and I couldn't wait so I got a pizza to go. It only takes 10 minutes for a to go pizza, FYI. Can't say much else since we did take out."
1,Delicious and amazing! Try the truffle flatbread and amazing prosciutto raviolis in pink sauce
1,best greek food i've had in a while!!!! grilled octopus for appetizer! grilled fish for entree! sooooo delicious.  highly recommended! definitely worth the trek to queens. didn't have to wait and went on a saturday afternoon.
1,"We needed to get away from the touristy restaurants of Times Square.  This was an excellent choice.  The ambiance was trendy, the service great, and the food awesome.  Great selection of Martinis and Mojitos.  We took our 11 year-old and her friend with us.  Great for well behaved children, not a place for tots or babies."
1,"Love the food! Everything we had was great! We had the oysters and clam belly and for our entrees we had the buttermilk fried qual meal (includes spoon bread... doesnt even make sense how amazing this was and collards which was some of the best ive ever had) as well as the trout. For dessert we ordered the banana bread pudding and coffee, surprisingly EVERYTHING was a perfect 10! I will certainly come here again and again and again... I checked out their brunch menu and it looka deeeeliiisshhhh, can't wait to try it! The service was awesome as well from all the servers, I love that they come and take care of eachothers tables too!"
1,"Its almost a ritual to come by here to grab a bite if you're in the area Service - 2/5 They're not the nicest and they don't say thank you but hey, its street food. Your standard street cart, sauces are self serve on the side unless you request to go Newcomers will notice that there are no menus so you'll have to ask someone inline or just listen to the people ordering up front Decor - A bustling street corner Food - 3.5/5 The chicken is always a bit dry and somtimes it can be pretty chunky. Theyre known for their chicken to be more on the shreded side Lamb - it looks like ground beef but it tastes great Hot sauce - its pretty spicy, probably on par with mamouns"
1,"The food is phenomenal. Expect to wait 30-60 min for brunch. BYOB is a plus. Cash only FYI. If calories didnt exist, I'd eat here every day. You won't find a more creative and delish brunch anywhere. I've been here about 4 times and it's always insane. Today they had French Toast balls in the menu. I already want them again. And the guy at the door who does te seating is hysterical. Do yourself a favor, go here and be nice when you have to wait its worth it."
0,"french little cute, the costumed staff were very frenchy cute also. the little cuteness of the plates cups and glasses were little and on the tiny side, but aware that they war very small and cute. the food taste was nice on cute little plates in a cute little room with cute little french looking service who spoke with french adorable accents. We will go again when in the cute village of the west."
1,"732nd review! I wanted to try the yellowtail collar but that was out. SAD FACE But, I also didn't have to wait on line (come after 10p) so that made up for it."
1,"This was my first time at Up Thai over the weekend and the experience was just okay for me.  The restaurant itself had a warm, inviting atmosphere and the waitstaff was very pleasant, patient and wonderfully accommodating. The food wasn't memorable; just so-so."
0,"LOVE this place. Wonderful food, lovely service. It's the perfect neighborhood spot. Very, very happy it's here."
1,"I seriously HATE when I crave Tacqueria because of how far away it is from my place. However, 9 out of the 10 times these cravings arise......I make the trip. AAAAND I'm never upset that I did. Where else in the city can you get bangin' $3 fish tacos? The guacomole is also absurdly good. Best Mexican bang for your buck in the city, hands down."
0,"It's whiny, privileged attention whores like Jeremy S. that make Yelp such an unreliable source of reviews about decent eateries like Jimmy's Diner. The food at Jimmy's is classic burger and fries Americana; Sal and all the other waiters at Jimmy's are decent, hardworking folks; I've eaten there for years and have never had a bad experience. Only a Williamsburg arriviste like Jeremy S., leading a privileged existence, would need to write such a vindictive review; there's no way that any waiter at Jimmy's would have raised his voice, especially for the reason listed in that review; its clearly a made up piece of BS. I openly invite Jeremy S. to push off to another neighborhood and let us enjoy our food at Jimmy's."
1,"Hour-long wait but I thought it was worth it. Besides, the hostess will call you when the table's ready so you can easily bar hop around the area for a bit. Everything I had was delicious. The Greek salad, the octopus, the spinach pie, and the scallops. Honestly, this was my first time ordering scallops as a main dish and wow, they did not disappoint. Also, they give you HUGE portions so keep that in mind. Even the grilled chicken was divine (and very cheap -- great healthy take-out option). Some servers can be a bit snobby and it can get wayyy too hot in the dining room. I'll be back. Really a 4.5"
1,"I saw the review for this on Yelp and I went on a search frenzy trying to find the place. I circled the block about 3-4 times before I finally found parking.  It was crazy.  I finally got there and it was packed like a can of sardines.... indication of good food? I'd think so. I ordered the pork n cabbage dumplings and the spicy noodles.  My total came to $5 bux even! $1 for 4 large dumplings and $4 for the noodles.  The dumplings were good. The noodles looked better than they tasted. They were spicy, but I think the cook forgot to add salt, so it tasted like it was missing something.  I wasn't overly impressed, but i think i'll try it one more time before I give it a definite rating. For now.... I give about 3.5 stars."
0,Out of all the west Indians restaurants I've been too this is the best I've ever had the food was extremely delicious the place was little small but it wash all worth it.
1,"B&B Winepub has some of the best burgers in Lower Manhattan!  I ordered the turkey burger with mozzarella cheese and tater tots.  Most restaurants serve turkey burgers very dry but B&B has pretty tasteful, juicy burgers!!! I also ordered the black cherry soda and the flavor was sooooo rich! I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch.  The price point is good too for the amount of food you will receive."
1,High quality Japanese meal and especially good value during lunch time.  Please do make reservation so to ensure prompt seating.  They are always packed around lunch time.  For about $15 you will be full and satisfied.
0,"My boyfriend and I came here on Saturday night for a late Valentines Day dinner and we couldn't be more impressed! We had originally made a reservation for 6:45. They called at 6:30 just to let us know we'd actually be sitting at 7. We arrived right at 7 and were immediately seated in this perfectly tiny restaurant at one of the private tables. We started with the wine list, quickly finding something we thought we'd like. Upon trying it I wasn't totally in love but for Graffiti staff that was no problem. The waiter and then owner worked with us to find a bottle of something much more our style even though it wasn't on the wine list. Onto the food! I eat a gluten free diet due to Celiac disease and the staff at Graffiti was AMAZING. We knew ahead of time that they would be accommodating based off of other reviews, and they were! I was able to eat almost everything on the menu. We ordered the pickled ginger scallops with GF toast, braised pork buns (1/2 on gf bread and 1/2 on regular bread), Chickpea crusted skate, and the Graffiti burger (again 1/2 on GF bread and 1/2 on regular)  All of the GF bread was Udi's, a brand I know and trust, which made the experience so great. Overall this place is amazing. While it is unique and definitely a small space Chef Jehangir Mehta does not disappoint. What are you waiting for? Make a reservation and go on your next date night at Graffiti!"
1,"Yes, a long wait. It can be tiring, boring, frustrating and almost kind of embarrassing to be waiting that long for something you can slurp up in less than 15 minutes but that's exactly what happened for me. We put our names down and after walking around, playing games, and people watching for a hour, we finally got a seat at the bar and immediately ordered so we can stuff our faces asap. I'm not that picky about ramen but I know what I like. Just based on what I witnessed and smelled, for some reason I was expecting to be let down. The aroma just didn't hit me with the same kind of love like other places but I was instantly proven wrong cause I didn't even stop for a sip of water until I finished the last drop of broth. I ordered the extra spicy pork ramen and the cook behind the counter was trying to warn me that it can be very spicy but I joked about how I was Korean and I can handle it. And I was proven right, it wasn't all that spicy at all. So maybe next time I'll ask for some extra spicy seasoning. The portion was near perfect and though the flavors were a tiny bit on the lighter side for me, I still enjoyed it immensely. Side note: bathroom is smaller than the ones on airplanes."
0,"This place is awesome! It has a warm atmosphere and the friendly staff are very warm as well! It gave me a very southern feel in the middle of Brooklyn which I enjoyed very much! Justin our waiter was FANTASTIC! I didn't receive the text they send to let you know your table is ready so my boyfriend arrived about 30min to closing and Justin was warm and greeted us with patience and as if the restaurant has opened and wasn't about to close. He was eager to take our order and my boyfriend and I just had to ask him why he was so pleasant and he answered simply ""because I love my job""! We are definitely going here again and if every server here is like Justin this place will be off the charts. By the way the food is Grrreeeeaaaaattttt! (Tony the tiger style)!"
1,"Good food, albeit at times, a bit salty.  GREAT Service as well, which is a plus in this nieghborhood.  An air of elegance without all the pretention; a fine dining experience!  try the Arctic Char!"
1,"This place is amazing.  They have various stations and some amazing food to eat. Try and go at another time beside ""prime time"" (read nights and weekends) unless you want to wait (particularly for the pizza). Above and beyond eating, however they have amazing shopping. The meat selection is fantastic. Nothing quite like some home made sausage or Piedmont steak to put in your fridge for dinner. People don't realize the difference a good cut of meat has until you have one. Once you do, it is difficult to go back. I learned this when I was a kid and so happy to find a good butcher like this near my neighborhood.  The olive oil selection and pasta selection is also amazing. Good job Eataly. Thanks for reading and enjoy."
0,"A group of friends and I were celebrating a birthday and decided we would like this spot out. I called the day before to find out if they'd take a reservation for 10 people. The girl I spoke to said that they don't take reservations. After attempting to get an idea of what kind of wait we would be looking at, we decided to give it a try. We arrived at about 6:30 and the place was empty (which was great!). Most of our party had arrived but they wouldn't seat us until everyone was there. The host asked if we would like to sit in their sitting area to have drinks and apps so we followed to the back of the restaurant and were led to what looked like a jail cell. The host then left and returned a few minutes later to inform us that their policy for large parties is that we each had to spend a minimum of $30 each. I told him that the woman I spoke with the night before hadn't mentioned anything and their website doesn't state this policy. We had traveled 40 minutes from Staten Island to come to their restaurant and they just throw this ""policy"" into the mix. We wound up leaving and going to SEA thai based on the principal of it! If I call and ask about a reservation and you have this kind of policy in place, you should at least inform your potential customers before they take the time to visit your business!"
1,"This place opened up down the block from me a few months ago and I immediately noticed the constant line outside this tiny little gem. I had to find out what the hype was about. Be prepared to wait an hour+ during normal meal times. The menu is simple and small and the place only seats about 15 people. Also this is CASH ONLY and does not take reservations. They service is fast and its a get in - get out once you are seated. Though I didn't find they pushed you to leave once you were done, which was nice. You would think $10 for a bowl of Ramen is not worth it, but I found the proportions extremely large, the noodles plump and the toppings to be savory and moist. Feel free to take the rest TO GO if you do not finish it all, which I did not. I had the traditional Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen with the Shredded Pork topping and a side of the Cheese Corn. The Ramen was excellent as was the Cheese Corn, but I was surprised to find this corn served cold! I think I would of preferred it warm but it was still good none the less. I say if you seen no one waiting outside this place, GO IN! But if you are in a hurry, skip it. But worth trying at least once."
1,"Excellent food, would love to go back again. Empanadas as an appetizer is a must."
0,I had steak egg n cheese for breakfast it was great. The service n environment was awesome.
0,2.50 for the best falafel sandwich you can have. Need i say anymore!
1,"I must apologize to my girlfriend for my lewd behavior at Locanda Verde, for having exposed you and my fellow diners to such a public display of depravity. There's no excuse for what I did. If you never forgive me, I'll understand. After all, you might be thinking: Why the hell should I ever forgive you, Franklin? You cheated on me! In the middle of our dinner! With a DUCK! Yes... yes, I did. I tried to resist, but the fennel-glazed duck ($27) was --- Fennel-glazed? You SICK bastard! Baby, I was weak. I was drinking and I'd just finished the sheep's milk ricotta ($12) and you know how that creamy deliciousness gets me going when I'm tipsy... My god, a sheep too? Who ARE you?! Look, just promise you'll never go near that duck again and we can work through this. Maybe. I'm sorry, honey. This duck and me... we're in love. I know it's crazy, maybe something's wrong with me, but being with that duck... it was the most amazing pseudo-sexual experience of my life. Every juicy bite of its pink tender meat was so perfectly flavored and rich that my knees shook from the sheer pleasure. Even our waitress was blushing. The whole restaurant was watching you two go at it! Fine, you deserve each other! We could've had everything babe, but if you want to give it all up for THAT, I won't stop you. ...... Oh duck. I wish I knew how to quit you."
0,"The quality of the thai food here is quite good. I had the pad thai here, it is just like I remembered it from a short stay in Thailand. The service is hurried and not paying too much attention. The place gets very crowded in the evening, and is definitely not great for a romantic dinner. Good value for money though."
0,Unpretentious yet inventive menu. Lovely space with friendly service. A very welcome addition to the neighborhood. Try the lamb tartare!
1,"Visiting New York for a couple of days.  Boyfriend at work.  Develop hankering for noodles.  Yelp to the rescue! This place sounded good per the other reviews, so I walked over to give it a try.   Walked right past it a couple of times before I found it, it's very small and not obviously signed. 3:30 on a Monday, a few tables but not busy.  Everyone was asian, good! Seated immediately, ordered the Ratchaburi crab & pork dry noodles on other's suggestions.   Came out super fast, looked delicious (actually, I was a little apprehensive about the pork at first, it looked too dry but tasted amazing), perfect portion size.  I ate it all without feeling still hungry or too full. They don't accept AMEX and credit card minimum is $15, so I ordered a Thai iced tea, which was delicious, and waited out the rain to walk back to the hotel. Service was very courteous. Missing a star for: Loud thai club music Low stool uncomfortable Seated a guy right across from me at my table when there were other tables and a bar.  Crowded me."
1,THE BESTTTTT.. It's a go to spot the minute I land in New York.
1,Love love love this place. The food is so good. Extremely reasonably price for a restaurant right off of times square. The service is impeccable. Highly recommend.
0,"This place just opened, and it's beautiful inside, the food is terrific and good for you (serious win) The people are really nice and helpful, everything was really fresh and good for the health conscious consumer I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! It's become my go to for an easy lunch or dinner, they even have wine and spices. Definitely a winner in my book!!!"
1,"Ok so I've been coming to Anella since it opened what like 2-3 years ago? Every visit has been a 5 star rating, not a single bad bite as other reviewers have posted. This is my go to neighborhood place - no doubt it's been the best food in Greenpoint for years. I bring out-of-towners here first. But I have to tell you about dinner tonight. For my 2nd Father's Day I want something special, so we go here. I spring for the NY strip steak. Wife gets the tagliatelle pasta. So the steak comes - its salty. Like, saltier than your Chinese food take out salty. Wifey agrees. And I *hate* being that guy, but I send it back. I'm like ""I'm really sorry but it's just too salty to eat"". Waiter (Ben, who rendered perfect service throughout) comes back a bit later with this gem: ""The chef took a sample and disagrees with the salt level but he'd like to know what you'd like him to do"". This is like saying ""the chef thinks you're crazy and he's sorry but how can he help?"". Well, what a super guy. Maybe this was my Pinot Grigio talking, but I thought that was just the most arrogant thing I'd ever heard in a restaurant as a customer, ever. It totally ruined my special dinner. I was fuming! Yes Ben thank you, I'll take a less salty steak, that'd be great. Meanwhile wifey's pasta is amazing. But I can't get over the a-hole chefs comment. So new steak comes after a reasonable wait: it's raw. Not rare, which I like just fine (I'd ordered medium rare). Purple and red about an inch in the from the edge, totally cool to the touch. Also was devoid of any seasoning whatsoever. This guy had taken it personally and now it was time for fun... Ben checks in ""how is everything""? I just lift the plate ""you tell the chef I said 'Don't cook aaaaangry' which he clearly is. Just take it off the bill and bring the check, please"". Ben saw the problem immediately and was obviously embarrassed. He comped the steak and our app - Salt cod fritters, delicious - as well. We left him 25%. I got to leave feeling all was right with the world. But a little sad I had to write this review after such a long amazing streak at this place. I told Ben I will be back."
0,"Went to Almond for brunch yesterday afternoon and it is now one of our top brunch spots. The location and outdoor seating is perfect, and the food was delicious. I had the omelette with chorizo -- definitely a repeat. The service was great. This place is awesome and will be in the brunch rotation."
0,"This is the coziest restaurant on the east side. Not really the place for a whole meal, but more for appetizers or one of their delicious pizzas. Amazing wine list and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the selection they offered. I will be back for certain."
1,"This is a great place fora quick lunch. The food is delicious and there is room to sit and hang out with friends. It does take some time between ordering and the food being ready - good to know if you have a few minutes to grab something.  My favorite is the cauliflower, and my friends like the halloumi cheese."
1,"I decided to try this place for lunch after seeing a lot of positive reviews. I have to say I was happy myself. It's not too far from where I work and they have healthy food options which taste good too. I ordered the 'Ultimate Plate' and the 'Alkaline Shake' - both turned out to be good choices. But, I have to admit there were so many other options on the menu that I would want to try, so I'm definitely going back to this place. The man behind the cash counter was courteous and pointed me to a much larger menu than what was in front of me on the boards in the restaurant. I have to say though, I felt the lunch was kind of expensive given that it cost me $20 (including tax and tip) for those 2 things. The plate was kinda big though, good enough to last me 2 full meals and I guess if the food is healthy, you've got to pay! One other thing that wasn't a deal breaker but not the most comfortable either that they have a small space inside the restaurant hence not enough tables to sit there and eat if you wanted to. Happy Eating!"
0,"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!! I feel terrible for giving this place a bad review because the people were so friendly. But, I didn't go to this restaurant with my wife tonight to be smiled at. The 50% off happy hour cocktails were $7 and were the most disgusting I have ever tasted. I had the minty one that tasted like Cool Burst Tylenol Cough Syrup, and my wife chose one that was supposed to be the Ukrainian equivalent of a Bloody Mary. Awful. The bread that was brought before the main course  was mediocre at best. Even more disappointing were the ""entrees."" Tiny portions and the food was definitely not fresh. The lettuce in our salads was spoiled. The Salmon on both of our dishes was edible, but not appetizing. Such a huge letdown! Overpriced food that's disgusting? NO THANKS!"
0,Very good time here with the family. They serve tapas style and the portions are pretty good especially compared to the price. Everything on the menu is exceptionally finger licking good you must try!
1,"I really like this place! It is my mom's favorite restaurant and everytime I walk in, I feel like it is my own personal Cheers. The barfly with the dark glasses who stands at the door is always full of compliments and friendliness. The guests are down to earth and interesting people. I would like to call it my local place one day! The food is great because it is traditional American but each dish has a cultured twist and a special local ingredient from the neighborhood. They could charge more for the quality and care they put into their meals.(But please don't.) I usually have the specials, but my favorite menu item is the Tuna sandwich with hand cut fries. Good fish, amazing bread with the perfect amout of cressa. The wine list has character; they manage to find the jewels in the rough with great taste and nice price. Beer selection is the best of any tavern I have been to in the area. Overall a great place to get  a good meal, a drink, and just let the day melt away! Thanks guys!!"
1,"Best pizza in New York. The place has become a tourist trap, but the pizza hasn't changed; they still use the same 100 year old brick oven."
1,"I  was told that most popular dishes at Momofuku restaurants are the steamed Pork Buns and the Ramen bowls.  I had already tried ramen bowl at Ma Peche, so this time I was determined to give the Pork Buns a try.  This was by far the coolest dish we had there.  I can't even begin to justifiably describe it.... but I will try.  So unusual and so very good.  The buns were ever so light and buttery in texture.  I have never eaten a bun so refined and delicate.  It's light flavor paired perfectly with the pork. The pork meat itself was another dazzler.  It was juicy and delicious....oozing wonderful flavors and reflecting pure finesse.  Finally, the hoisin sauce was a great accent with its lightly sweet flavor to compliment the pork meat.  I am quite certain that I will never EVER pass up on ordering the pork buns whenever I am at a Momofuku restaurant. We tried the Charred Spanish Octopus.  Excellent choice as well.  As I was biting into this dish it occurred to me that the genius of David Chang lies in two things:   His comprehensive understanding of ingredients and their flavors. His expertise in the treatment of those ingredients  - specially the meats, and seafood. As I explained, the pork in the pork buns were cooked to perfection so that all kinds of tender, juicy goodness oozed out of it as I bit into it.  The octopus meat was another shining example, it was cooked so gently - resulting in the tenderest bite of octopus meat I have ever had! We ordered three other dishes that sadly did not impress me as much.  Glad to realize that even David Chang is a human after all (or maybe its just me turning into a total food snob?)  The Duck Pot Pie was on the dry side for my taste.  When I dig into a pot pie, I like to see the interior ooze out in all its glory.  This one did not.  The Fuji Apple Kimchi confused me a bit.  It was a gorgeous dish to look at though.  Finally, the Duck Saam.... their signature dish.  I believe its beauty lies in the wonderfully flavorful and juicy Duck meat.  I am told it is cooked for hours.  I could clearly tell that it was prepared with a lot of love and care.  But it was served with a lot of rice and a scallion pancake.  I am sure that in the Korean culture, this is exactly what people like, and expect... but for me, the whole dish read ""dry"", despite the juicy duck meat."
0,"Halal is Islamic food when cows, lamb, chicken etc. are beheaded in a halal way according to the Sharia""  Specially for me, as a Muslim, there are restrictions for us to eat whatever we feel like..due to the city not having much Halal restaurants and dinning areas. So my only options are these Halal stands whenever I'm around the city. The food is awesome and has the that Middle Eastern/Indian spice remixed!! But, beware of the hot sauce! Extremely flammable to the core!! I'm Bengali, I've been trained to consume spice & chilli since birth as my tradition lol So I take alot of hot sauce but for the local New Yorkers, I suggest a teaspoon & half is sufficient to get your eyes pouring tears, your taste buds crying and screaming ""Mom"" or ""Help!"" & your nose melting butter.. lol do not be scared as I may over-exaggerate but it would be a good experience for ppl to try out a different cultural food. So go there and take 6 bucks out of your wallet and eat like there's no tomorrow!!!!! & if there is a tomorrow, you'll be on the run for more! Once it was even lined up with 100 ppl 5am in the morning! Now that's what you call food to die for!"
1,"A couple of nights ago, I was meeting my cousins who were visiting from California.  They asked me to pick a place for dinner so I asked them what they were in the mood for and one of them suggested Italian food.  So I went on yelp and looked for places near their hotel and found this restaurant.  We got there around 9:45pm and were seated almost immediately.  Unfortunately, they said that there was no room and it was closing in the garden for us to be seated.  I was looking forward to it but so I was a little bummed.  But I didn't let it get to me.  The waiter took a little while to come and take our orders but we were too busy catching up so I was the only one who noticed.  He apologized anyway so no biggie. There weren't a lot of items on the menu.  Prices were very decent.  One of my cousins had a pasta dish with spaghetti and meatballs, my other cousin had the fettuccine alfredo dish, their friend had a calamari dish, and I had the antipasto misto salad as a meal.  The serving sizes were decent but could be kind of small for those with a big appetite.  One of my cousins had an Italian beer that he seemed to really like and my other cousin had a different kind of beer (I don't remember what kind) he also seemed to enjoy.  The waiter was actually very nice and was giving my cousins tips on places to go and see in New York City.  Overall, it was a good experience.     Ps.  I'd like to go back and have dinner in the garden.  When I went to the bathroom I got a glimpse of it and it looked quaint and cozy."
0,"I'm not sure why any of the Dos Toros locations have anything less than five stars on yelp. I don't get it.  Do people not know what a proper burrito is supposed to taste like?  Because I'm seriously confused.   This place deserves six stars.  The folks over at Dos Toros via my homeland (California! What! What!) have nailed it.  Now, I no longer have those sad dark nights lamenting my burrito-free diet."
0,"Hubster wanted to come here for some time..I, on the other hand, was a bit ambivalent..unimpressed with the menu online, but that was then. Craving Italian tonight..thought, ""why not""? Upon entering..loved the cozy vibe of the place. Reception was warm and the food..OH THE FOOD!!! Crab Crostini:  very good. Fritto Misto:  divine..one of the best! Baby kale salad:  so good! Steamed clams:  oh my..killer broth! Spaghetti all' Amatriciana:  delicioso! Veal wrapped in pancetta:  wow!! Spumoni:  deconstructed & delicious! Could've been perfect, but the service ran hot & cold. Overall, we'll definitely return."
0,"The ""philly saitan sandwich"" was generous but salty and greasy, I guess it meets the demand of the young, vegan and hungry ;)"
1,"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and ended up staying for 6 hours, nourished by the $5 draft options that were great. Super friendly staff, the burger w/ egg was delicious and filling, and amazing tap selection that gets changed up fairly often."
1,"I just moved to NYC, and the La Petite Abeille is thus far, my favorite restaurant. C'est parfait! The waiters are super attentive and semi-gorgeous, and the moules et frites are the best I've had since Lyon, France. Eating outside on the little patio is also a very romantic treat. I think it's a great date place, and relatively affordable. Also, on Tuesdays, you can get wine for half off. We went with the Mud House white, which was kind of a-m-a-z-i-n-g. Will definitely be back for more yummy dinners."
1,I am in brooklyn almost every weekend and my friend came into town from Oregon. A bunch of friends and I went to Grimaldis and waited on line for atleast 45 mins to an hour... but boy was it worth it. the pizza was great here and the customer services is awesome too. You are treated like family and in a good way. I came back here with just my gf and it was prob 95 degrees outside hot and we didnt eat anything all day. they brought out ice cold water for everyone which was great. great place try it if you never have and the pizza is awesome.
1,"Wooed by the hipster display of gourmet packaged foods in the front windows, and the cute seating in back, I was really underwhelmed by the meal itself.  The special soprassata sandwich ($7) was tiny and on a cold hard roll, presumably pre-made and sitting in a fridge out back.  The meat itself was tasty, but piled up in the center of the roll, so that the outside bites were all mustard-smeared bread, while the inside bites were essentially pura carne.  So poorly done. After re-compiling the sandwich, and letting it warm up to room temperature, it was actually edible, but really nothing special.  With Brooklyn Bread on the corner, 'Snice down the street, and Russo's just a couple of blocks away, I can say I don't plan to return for the sandwiches.   The bake-able items looked intriguing, though..."
0,"I really like the enchiladas here.  But half the time they mes up the order.  I even make it a point to ask if it comes with guac every time, and they STILL forget to put it in.  It's really frustrating. Get it together.  I like your food but your service is god awful."
1,"I never knew this place existed but I went with my mom, aunt and a friend. My mom and aunt said it was THE ultimate hangout in the 70s. My aunt said she came here one night and Mick Jagger and David Bowie were there and it was completely normal--no crazy paparazzi or anything. Anyways, we went for brunch the other day. The waiter was really nice and friendly, as was the hostess. Everyone enjoyed their food--from fries to pancakes to granola to the delicious spinach quiche I ate. Pretty reasonably priced, I would definitely go here again and highly recommend it."
1,"There's always a line, but it doesn't really matter since the line moves pretty quick. Imposters are everywhere, right next to it, street corner, down the street. But if you want the real thing go to the one with the line. It's worth the wait. I usually like drenching mine with artery-clogging white sauce. They give you a good amount of meat to rice ratio with a few pieces of lettuce here and there. Be warned, the hot sauce is hot. Don't want to sound like a broken record, but a little dribble here and there is good enough. I forgot how hot it was and laid on a streak of the hot sauce and my lips were burning."
1,"The restaurant is 4.5 stars but I rounding up to 5 because of the boulangerie. The cakes are moist and flavorful, the cookies the perfectly sized and not too sweet. The coffee is amazing, but not because of the taste(it's good coffee), it is because of the lid. They have a re-sealable lid that's really re-sealable. Are you listening Starbucks? The bread is great if a bit overpriced. Good bread is easy to find in Manhattan so I would buy my bread elsewhere."
1,"not real happy with a ""char"" burger that has no char on it? asked med-well got served a bleeding mess. sent it back and it returned grey and steaming like they'd nuked it or something...fire doesn't do that to meat. and at $17 i could have gone to shake shack twice. pretty ridiculous that i was sitting at the bar and there's a napkin near me soaking up the water dripping onto the bar from the AC. not what you'd expect from a place that has a $27 burger on the menu."
0,Food and wait staff just OK.  Management  still living in 1989.  I lived through arrogant-for-the-sake-of-it BS attitude then as a newbie in NYC- times have changed.  Are you serious?
0,"Finally -- an amazing cafe catering to crisp, fresh, healthy options!  I was walking through the village on a beautiful Friday and happened on Ellary's Greens -- how lucky was I.    I dined on the fresh Tuscan Salad with spicy BBQ Shrimp.  It was out of this world.   Ellary's also has a terrific wine list -- at reasonable prices!   Great service -- hip crowd.   I'm so glad it's in the neighborhood!     My advice -- go early, it was getting busy... Gold Stars!!!!"
0,"This was our first time to Little Italy... And our first time to this quaint little Italian gem! The owner was making meatballs when we walked in.  It truly doesn't get any more fresh! We ate so much, they had to roll us out the front door. We really enjoyed speaking with the owner about his family history. The menu is HUGE! We tried several different dishes and each was DELISH! Very authentic! Sizes were perfect, presentation very nice as well. This is a VERY SMALL place.  I'm guessing during dinner hours there must be a long wait! If you are visiting NYC, I'd put this place on your must try list!"
0,"Walked up to the front door, hostess walked outside from bar next door (that they own and ask waiting folks to sit at while wiaitng for a dinner table). She asked us for our name, told us it would be an hour - this was a monday night. I peeked inside and there were table seats open, and bar stools opens. Asked if we could sit at the bar to eat, the hostess quickly said those bar seats are also for the wait list. We put our name down, and gave our cell phone #. Never got a call from them."
1,"We came on a Sunday, the crowd was lo-key and it was easy to get  a seat. f you love spicy mouth watering bloody marys..... umm,Yes please!  It is a homemade recipe by the lovely bartender Laurie. It has the spice, the sweet, the magic every bloody lover looks for.  She brings it every Sunday. Another great cocktail (cant remember what its called)... shaken like a martini it has vodka, olive juice, pickle juice, and a dash of tobasco. Oh, and wait for it... a freaking pickle is the garnish! I found a new favorite. The food was good, the drinks were great, and the bartender was awesome! We will return."
0,"Go there for the pizza. Obviously. This is the best pizza I've ever had and as an Italian girl who has been eating New York pizza for decades, it beats every other one. Yes, the service is slow and there is a substantial wait, however when was the last time you went to a pizza parlor for exceptional service? That's mind-numbing. You frequent the pizza place deemed best in New York for one reason: the pizza. AND THIS PLACE DOESN'T DISAPPOINT! The crust is slightly chewy with pockets of crisp. The cheese is melted so it's stringy, but not rubbery and the toppings are fresh. We ordered sundried tomato and basil and were floored with how every bite was better than the last. The real secret is the sauce. I'm not sure why it's so good, but it's not too salty, not too acidic yet leaves a perfect balanced taste in your mouth. Unfortunately, there is a wait so I'm not visiting Grimaldi's often, but I'll be craving it every day until the next time I do. Clearly, anyone who knows good pizza and has eaten at Grimaldi's knows it's the best they'll have in NYC."
0,"Out of this world service and some top-notch food! I ordered their ever-famous fries and the foi-gras patte. This restaurant is not for everyone, and is not a normal visiting site as it is rather high-end and pricey. I don't think this place needs any advertisement as they are always bustling with customers either in the restaurant or the bakery. Everyone has to try this place at least once."
1,"Food fantastic. Atmosphere is loungey and class. Drinks are made well, not watered down. And service is on point. Defiantly coming back. Big time."
0,"A small group of us went to dine at this local spot that eveyrone kept talking about. We heard it gets crowded and that's it's cash only. We went early on a Tuesday night, 6pm the place was empty except for one other patron and her child. We were a part of 6, 5 with one on the way to from work. The host literally argued with the 5 of us for 15 minutes about holding 6 seats at a table of 6 since we all weren't there. He insisted he take a table away which makes it a table for 4 with one chair set on the side. We explained that she was on her way we would order for her etc. but alas no. Did I mentioned the place was EMPTY!!! We called our friend told her don't bother we weren't staying long and we'd bring her food at home. Next time I would advise the owner to teach his staff manager to treat the actual customers who are in the restaurant and about to drop cash on food and drink with more importance then the potential customers that never arrived. I am a native Brooklynite and can honestly say outside of the behavior of the staff that the food was average Italian red sauce stuff making me feel not disappointed for deciding we are never going back."
1,"Best thing about Alta is the fried goat cheese with lavender infused honey, followed closely by the architecture and atmosphere of the building itself.   You enter by stepping down into a nondescript lower level of a 10th street townhouse in the Gold Coast area of Greenwich Village.  After passing through a nice bar area, you walk into a room that has been transformed into something from the South of Spain.  Large, open two-story high indoor court with balcony tables on the upper level.  Fake windows with light similar to a setting sun.... the environment is great for a date or relaxing dinner out. The other dishes were all also very good, tapas-style and full of flavor.  Grilled mozzarella skewers, truffle mushroom dumplings, roasted sea bass, all were great! Only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is (in my opinion), very over-priced for what you get.  Dinner for 4 here cost me upwards of $250 and we had to grab pizza on the way home because we were all still hungry. Food was great, though."
1,"I spaced out and left my debit card on the table here. When I called Cheryl's the next morning, they said nobody found a card. When I called my bank, they said that someone had tried to get money out of an ATM using the wrong pin number. Great restaurant, but watch out!!!"
0,"If you are reading this on your iPhone, just go inside, it's freakin amazing. The Scene I love the East Village and all the tiny, amazing, restaurants, but nothing compares to the intimacy you'll find in Graffiti.  It's like being in the belly of a sailboat, where everything, including the 12 people in the restaurant (staff & patrons), has its place.  The vibe is electric and fun.  It's a great place for anything from a date to a small group of friends - as long as you make a reservation. The Food Off the hook good.  Seriously.  Everything we had ranged from fantastic to freakin amazing.  Their food has a lot of style to it, not overly delicate undetectable ingredients kind of style, but things like braised pork buns with apricot chutney.   Mmm...chutney. Top 3 Favorites 1. Pickled Ginger Scallops, Candied Red Chili 2. Braised Pork Buns, Apricot Chutney 3. Squid & Lotus Root Stir-fry With Poppyseed & Curry Leaf Cons We had nearly everything on the menu.  Only complaint: super tasty everything, but not enough everything - their entire menu has about 13 items, and all of them are tapas style.  We'd have loved to either have a few items that were more substantial or even more of their amazing mini dishes."
0,"as a native Los Angeleno, I never thought i'd acquire the most serious tan of 2010 standing in a pizza-line in Brooklyn.  90 minutes in, i was convinced i myself had been in grimaldi's coal burning oven. word to the wise: wear sunblock. i'm serious. okay, so the pizza was delicious.  we ordered a large pie with extra basil.  when trying ""good pizza"" i don't believe in throwing a bunch of toppings on it until i know how i feel about the basic version.  and suffice it to say that grimalidi's did an excellent job.  easily top 5 of my life... probably top 3.   prepare for a long wait and a slight burning sensation if you go during daylight.  the service is hurried and the line sucks, but i'm a big believer that good things come to those who wait.  enjoy."
0,"after visiting Queens comfort a couple of times, I think it'll be a long time before I go again. Last time, I ordered the mac&cheese and it never came.  By the time I got the waiters attention my friends had eaten and I found my meal so big and heavy that I didn't even bother to tell the waiter.  But still had to fight to get it off my bill. Oh well, I was hoping for better once they started doing brunch.  but not so much."
1,"Yummy, cheap, and reminds me of home!  Service isn't great, but with food this good at such low prices, who cares?  I love the soy milk, roti canai, hainanese chicken rice, prawn mee, and bah kut teh-- stuff I usually eat when I'm at home in Indonesia/Singapore, so it's very comforting.  The dishes are flavorful and pretty authentic, and I'm definitely going to go back to try other things."
0,This place was in so many guides we had to try it. They were right. As close to a Parisien bistrot that you will find. Started with the onion soup which was spectacular. Practically a meal in itself. The bread was amazing. I had the duck confit which was excellent and my wife had the trout salade which was equally good. No room for dessert unfortunately. Definitely a keeper.
1,Excellent Cajun food. Really nice wait staff. Wished it was located in Manhattan. We'll definitely return if we're in the neighborhood.
0,Awesome small brunch spot!!!! Delicious breakfast platters and yummy cappuccinos ! Come here as often as I can to enjoy great food.
1,"Philipino restaurants in the bay area are nothing like this.  With a modern twist and a bar for the alcoholics, this is why I love coming to NYC.     About a year ago, I came here for brunch the Saturday after Hurricane Sandy, and yes despite the limited resources they were working with, they were still able to come out with a delightful brunch meal.  I had the sig sig mix with an egg on top of garlic rice and my friend had the sausages.  Those sausages were pretty damn good actually.  It reminded me of Portuguese sausages by the sweetness.  We also had the Philippino porridge which is nothing like the porridge I'm use to.  THis one is extra savory and perfect for a somewhat chilly morning. ...must come back."
0,"I do not even know where to start. The service here is AWFUL and the food is OK. I lived in NYC for over ten years and love going out to eat and trying new spots. This was my second time back so I feel I can finally review it. The hostesses are the rudest I have ever encountered in any dining experience. If you ask a question, they laugh at you and roll their eyes. I felt compelled to write a review bc I do not understand how this place is still so busy. It is not that great. Last time I went for my sister in law's 35th bday. They brought all our food out cold and forgot her meal. Not only did they not apologize at all, they then brought out her new meal cold and raw too with again, no apologies at all. We were in shock. They just didn't seem to care at all. After brining out cold, undercooked food we all sat there with empty wine glasses and water glasses. We finally said something and the manager came over and didnt seem to care that much either. I do not get it at all. When this has happened at other restarunts like LAVO in NYC the managers have come over, apologized profusely and offered to buy a round of drinks, etc; however, I guess this establishment thinks they are too good for that. If you are considering going -- do not. There are hundreds of other restaraunts so much better, and so much more worth you money!!"
0,"Great ambiance, food, service and oh yes, a very kind and handsome David! Thanks for such a great evening! A MUST, if in New York!

Please note, am not the Mary Suzanne L. that sent a review, previously. Thank you!"
0,"Rose Water has always been a favorite brunch place of mine, but I only recently tried their dinner and was sadly disappointed to have it fall short of my high expectations. I had dinner there with the Park Slope Dinner Club, a group of proud Brooklynites that gathers monthly to eat our way through the neighborhood. We loved the atmosphere and our waiter Wolf was super nice. We all ordered from the Market Menu. The bread was superb and was my favorite part of the meal. Others really enjoyed the shaved fennel salad, creamy polenta, and the roasted chicken. The tile fish failed to impress, as did the soup, which were both too salty. The most disappointing part of all was the dessert. The meyer lemon treat was not at all what we envisioned from its description and the pear cobbler could have used some more time in the oven. Both were OK and a far cry from the delight we hoped for."
1,"I went back here again and did not like the food this time!!  My food was way too salty.  Also, they started serving their awesome chutney/sauces in plastic squeeze bottles now!  I dunno, that kind of killed it for me."
0,"hello ramen! im a ramen fan and i am an even bigger ramen and pork bun fan. there are so many types of great ramen on the menu. the only part i dont like about the place is that they dont take reservations and the wait is usually VERY long. If I werent for that, i would give them 5 stars."
1,Great food! Very authentic Spanish (from Spain) food. It was as if I was back in Pamplona and Galicia :)
0,This place is wonderful.  Inexpensive and the food is very tasty.  There is a nice bar as well..  Just moved to the neighborhood and I will be back.
0,mmmmmmmmmm so tasty and good
0,Had lunch their after shopping food was awesome!!!!
0,the food and wine delivered but did not come up to the level of the beautiful surroundings and excellent service. The black pasta was overhyped.
1,"I very rarely review on here, tending to use Yelp as a one-way tool, directly from my cell phone to my stomach. However, Silver Rice has inspired me. I went with my girlfriend tonight and we had the rice bowls. Holy cow. Friggin' delicious. Fresh fish, fresh rice, spicy, portable, and cheap. $6 for a filling portion. I will be back. Soon. And often."
0,"Had a dinner date here during the week - early evening.  My date was rather late, but we were graciously seated when she arrived.  I was so into her that I can't even remember what we ate (I think she had steak frites and I had trout) - the tables are a bit close together so conversation couldn't be too intimate, but overall, I liked the atmosphere and food."
1,"This restaurant is oh so good.  I ordered the spinach salad, assuming it would be a dry, boring ordeal, but no. It had a delicately poached egg on top, and the whole thing had this scrumptious dijon vinaigrette with prosciutto-esque meats draped along the sides. It was phenomenal.  I split the pork meatballs with my friend, and at the end we weren't too stuffed, so we split the chocolate mousse-with this delicious homemade peanut brittle on the side. Heavenly.  I thought I had ended up spending a little more than I should have, but the entire bill was ~$40 for two people with an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert. So reasonable, even for two students.  Everything is local and the place is furnished so cozily that I will definitely be back, maybe for brunch next time!!"
1,"It's a pleasant restaurant with a great atmosphere and good food. We had lunch at this nice place in a busy Saturday afternoon. The service was gracious and polite, the food is very good. There are also excellent desserts. Highly recommended."
0,"Gramercy Tavern was very good in any kind of foods, drinks, desserts and the service was accurately great. And it's a place where we can bring our friends, family, relatives and even our love ones. The place is perfect for me because it's formal, romantic and amazingly in anything. Not to compare others but its a choice., people have there own taste and idea's for choosing of what fits for them., but furthermore Gramercy tavern is my top 10th restaurant that I really like."
1,"Came here with a small group for some food. There is not much seating at all, but we were able to grab a table. We ordered a cheese platter consisting of brie, mozzarella, hard ricotta, and olives. We also ordered cannolis, which we shared. It was amazing. They also have very huge sandwiches. Two people could easily share one for a meal. I plan on going back to try one. You order food at the counter, and they call you when it is ready. You also have to bring your plates/boards up to the counter when you are done eating."
0,"I can easily say I've been stopping in to Le Barricou for brunch at least once a month for the past 2 or so years... until now.  I can no longer ignore their steady decline.  I'd say that things started to change towards the end of this past summer.  First they took away the complimentary croissants and then portion sizes got smaller and smaller.  I used to leave brunch feeling full, now I leave hungry!  When they say dishes come with a side of home fries and salad, that means about 6ish pieces of potato and 8 pieces of lettuce.  And I used to love their salad dressing, I think it was a simple lemon vinaigrette; not anymore.  My boyfriend used to love their french toast, it used to come with 3 slices, now 2 and it used to come out hot, now it comes out at room temperature if you're lucky. I go in today and for the first time I ordered the side of fruit with my meal for $5.  When it came out I was shocked!  They gave me a small bowl with 1 strawberry, 5 small pieces of honeydew, 5 blueberries, 1 blackberry and a couple small pieces of pineapple.  For real?  I could still see the bottom of the bowl!  Anyway, so I eat a few pieces of fruit and not only was it a stife portion, but the fruit tasted like onion.   Bleh, I'm over it!!!! Time to find a new brunch spot."
1,"Great great food - always consistent, the staff is super chill and fun, while always being professional. The brunch is amazing try the Moroccan egg benedict, and all the little sides are so tasty, the cucumber yoghurt, the falafel...i go there everyweek and seriously the quality of the food is outstanding for that price. Also must try their lunch deal: soup or salad and tagines or couscous. Really good deal for 17 dollars I think... Enjoy!"
1,"I love this place, the food is amazing.  I've only done delivery, which does take quite some time, but I don't really mind.  I am a huge fan of the veggie pomegranate tacos and the gnocchi (rice cake) - try it, yum!!"
1,"Ward III NY:Manhattan: TriBeCa 12pm Friday 10th day of the 10th month 2014 Four Stars After visiting night court and getting an individual out of jail, I stumbled to a bar to relax and perhaps find a new client. Ward III is spacious with a central bar, two bartenders, and some comfortable seating on the periphery complete with cocktail service. The place was about 1/4 filled. I had a Rittenhouse Sazerac ($15) and Corpse Reviver #2 ($14). The music was a bit loud for the atmosphere and I was surprised by the frequent dance numbers. Overall a decent place to grab a drink."
0,"I'm obsessed with this place.  Bistro burger and fries are amazing.  This place is the real deal--its great food, great atmosphere and very inexpensive.  Why would you want anything else-- and they're open and serving food until 4am. If you live in the neighborhood there is nothing better.  Also you can skip the crowd and call you order in."
0,"Bartender was great, attentive and the waiters were spectacular.  Drinks were perfect, not too light, not to strong.  Food was fantastic.  Great time to be had!"
0,"One of my favorites.  Great food, ambiance and service."
0,I was there the other day for the first time and honestly it was one of the best korean food i had in a while and it is not too pricey.  Definitely go there again for lunch.
1,"I came here a few times when I had jury duty, and I absolutely loved it.  Apparently everyone and their mom does too, because there's always a long line here. If you don't know you might complain that the guy would take forever to serve people, but once you get to the front, you understand why.  The guy spends quite some time to cut up a LOT of meat to squeeze into that little foil container. Also, you don't have to wait in line if you want something from the hot bar (like dumplings), but there is no other reason to come here other than the roast pork. BTW, roast PORK is not the same as roast PIG.  I usually solve that problem by ordering both."
0,"nice food, but a lot of visitors :) not possible relax"
0,"Ive been to taqueria diana 3 times. The first two times, I waited 15 minutes for a quesadilla even though I was the only customer. The third time I ordered the al pastor burrito *with* sour cream and cheese. Unfortunately I ordered to go, and only later found out that I had gotten the worst tasting pork burrito *without* sour cream or cheese. The food is ok, but the service is poop. I'm never going back."
1,Carbs never tasted so amazing!
1,"I love it's rich history! We went in during happy hour and had some fish and chips, buffalo wings and bewa. Pretty large size! And pretty good atmosphere!"
0,"Big fan, been a few times.  The cowgirl burger is my go to.  The staff is always nice, but I go at lunch time so not sure what it like when its crowded, but lunch there is consistent and great."
0,"So I just moved to the neighborhood and heard great things. The reviews were right, very delightful meal. The Cous Cous with chicken is a must & avocado toast. I'll be dining here once a week."
1,"This place is excellent. Great ambience, the food is delicious. Pizza tastes great, duck pasta is exactly what you want it to be, chicken wing lollipops are so good, and dessert pop'em donuts are excellent. And on top of that, two of out party wanted to pay separately, a lot of restaurants complain about that but this waiter was 100% cool, ""whatever you need to do!"" Cool about it, it was great. Go here."
1,"I've been here three times and is marked as a regular and I haven't wrote a review yet. How sad is that? Well the time has come to share my expertise on this place. This wonderful and delicious place that I can't help craving. I found this place on yelp of course. It was one of the top hot yelp picks or whatever it's called. It wasn't at the top of my list to try, but since Clinton St. Baking Co had an hour plus wait, me and my boyfriend decided to try meatballs for lunch instead of pancakes. It was the best choice we ever made. The first time we came here, it was packed. I think it was around 1pm or so and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. There isn't anywhere to wait inside so we sat outside and waited. No one was seated outside because it was freezing. Once we were seated, it was a little cramped. The back of my chair was touching the back of someone's chair. But it was okay. The restaurant was a decent size and also had a bar filled with so many types of wines. Anyway, we were greeted by our waitress right away and was brought iced water. She asked if we ever came there to eat and we said no. So she explained to else everything on the menu and recommended some of her favorites. We have our own markers and we mark what we want on the menu and she takes it for our orders. It's pretty cool. So there are the naked balls which are 4 meatballs with a sauce. You can choose from spicy pork, beef classic, chicken, veggie, salmon? I believe and also the special ball of the day. Usually it changes daily. And then you choose a sauce: mushroom gravy, spicy meat, classic tomato, Parmesan cream or pesto. That is $7. You can also choose a side dish which is an extra $4 and you can choose to have it under your naked balls or on the side. My boyfriend got the spicy pork with the spicy meat sauce over spaghetti. I quote ""it is the best spaghetti ever."" He loved it. I thought it was pretty good as well. Now we move on to the sandwiches. There are the ""heroes"" which comes with 3 meatballs with the same choices above as well as a sauce which are the same above as well. Then you choose between provolone or mozzarella. I recommend the mozzarella, it is absolutely fresh and you can believe that they make it in-house. So good.  Then you choose a wheat or white baguette. The second time I came here I got the classic beef with pesto, mozzarella on wheat. It was absolute heaven! It comes with a side salad as well. That was good too! The third time I came here I got another hero with the special ball of the day which was bolognese. I got it with spicy meat sauce and mozzarella on wheat. That was NOT a disappoint. SO good. OMG you have no idea...(hero = $9) The other sandwiches they offer is the ""smash"" which is two meatballs with a sauce and cheese. It's on a regular burger bun. It was my least favorite. The bun became soggy and it was hard to eat. I ended up having it dissect it and eat with a fork. I tried the smash with classic beef balls with mushroom gravy and mozzarella. The mushroom gravy was FANTASTIC. One of my favorite sauces. The ""smash"" is 8 dollars and it comes with a side which you could substitute with another if you do not prefer salad. i got the mashed potatoes and it was really buttery. Too buttery for me. I would pass on trying that as a side. Lastly, the other items on the menu I never tried. The sliders. One meatball, one sauce. Best way to try all the meatballs. Three dollars each. Then there is the 8 dollar ""salad"" that comes with 3? 4? meatballs atop a salad. That seems pretty good. I would have to try that next time when I'm not tempted to get the hero, which would be really hard. For dessert, me and my boyfriend tried the ice cream cookie sandwich. It was raved all over yelp so we HAD to try it. I didn't see what the big whoop was about. It wasn't good. I mean, it tasted fine, but it was hard to eat and the cookies were really hard. The ice cream was fantastic though. Homemade and delicious. I tried vanilla and their special for that day, cinnamon. It is worth it to get a side of ice cream for two dollars if you have room for dessert. In the end, this place is really awesome. I'm a regular and I discovered this place less than a month ago. Me and my boyfriend came back two days later after trying this place for the first time. The second time around my boyfriend on classic beef with mushroom gravy over rigatoni. It was really good. I love this place. It is literally a New York MUST. It's located on the lower east side which sucks to get to, but it's not that bad compared to Clinton St. Baking Co. Anyway, ENJOY! Please GO!"
1,"If you love fresh pasta and great Italian food, dining at Supper is a must. This small restaurant in the East Village has that certain New York vibe we all seek when dining out in the city yet still retains the Mom & Pop charm of hole-in-the-wall finds as evidenced from the family photo on the menu. Everything we had amazed our senses and taste buds. We joked that even though we ordered way too much food, we couldn't imagine not having tried any of the following: Focaccia with white beans & garlic-infused olive oil (I've never had beans served as a bread accompaniment and now I can't imagine a better pairing) Bruschetta (The tomatoes used are some of the plumpest, firmest, most delicious I'v ever tasted. I also love that the bread is grilled.) Mozzarella di bufalo (Incredible fresh, creamy mozzarella and, again, those tomatoes!) Black kale panzanella (unlike any kale salad I've ever had - loved the bread in this dish, too) Spaghetti al limone (Refreshing, satisfying, and so unique) Spinach gnocchi (This is perfection) Tiramisu (Could rank among the best tiramisus I'v had) The prices are extremely reasonable, especially for New York. Though, be prepared with cash - no credit cards accepted. If you can, try to sit in front of the grill for a wonderful dining experience where you can watch the chefs work their magic. The wait staff is accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu. If you have questions, ask for recommendations. They won't lead you astray."
0,"If you don't find something you want to eat on this menu, you're just not hungry.  Great selection of food, wine, cocktails and beer... along with a great vibe."
1,"I wasn't a fan of Ippudo, and people that share that sentiment have all told me to head to Totto instead. I am now in agreement with those people, and will happily share my views. Totto, the original location anyway, is small, much smaller than Ippudo. Even though we arrived prior to opening (on a Saturday, natch), our placement on the list still generated a 30 minute wait. Those on the outside looking in were constantly told to check out the new, bigger location. So there's that. I'm a huge fan of the layout, though. Ramen with a view, I call it. Particularly if you sit at the bar, you get the full picture of the ramen-making process. There's the brothmaster, the expert noodle shaker, and the bowl-synthesizing wizard. My compadre went mega ramen (the original in a bigger bowl), while I went with spicy. The ""Totto"" broth, for all ramen aside from the vegetable, is chicken-based, an interesting choice. It's a fair bit lighter than I like; conversely, I didn't sink like a stone afterwards like I would've with a heavy tonkotsu. The spicy option was rather minute as well, more like a spoonful of the hot oil you'd find in Chinatown versus a full-on dunking into the deep end. Broth is rather important to me, but I tend to favor ramen where the noodles are spectacular. Totto's falls slightly short of excellent, missing just an oomph of springiness and texture that would bump it into the upper echelon. I did find it miles ahead of Ippudo in terms of taste. For the accoutrements, I thought the char siu was good, while the bowl was heavy on the scallions. Adding a hardboiled egg is a must. The sucker looks like it goes above the haloed 63 degrees, but still has an amazingly soft yolk with the traditional Asian textured white. Overall, Totto was worth the wait, especially with bar seating. And now I'm craving some ramen. Great."
0,"refering to michael m's posting about having a reservation at 8:30 and  being told it would be another 20 minutes  until they would be seated  is straight up malarkey. i live in the neighborhodd and have frequented the restaurant a few times. the place does not accept reservations, i know frirst hand, i tried to make them myself over the phone when they first opened and was told  by the hostess that they only accept walk-ins. i'm sure if  the restaurant did take your resrvation it  would probably be because you were a friend of either the chef, owner or someone who worked there. i'm sorry but your review sounds malicious and are trying to bash the place intenionally. listen, the place has it's issues just like any new restaurant that 's been open a few weeeks and is as busy as they are. but your posting sounds like a straight up fib, especially while your also trying to personally attack the chef for making the rounds in the dining room. stick to real purposeful and insightful reviews not personal attacks my man."
1,DO THEY PUT A WHOLE STICK OF BUTTER IN THE BROTH?  DO THEY PUT A WHOLE STICK OF BUTTER IN THE BROTH?  so rich and i had to skim off a whole layer of fat off.  practically was oil and that was like 50% of the broth.  we felt like we were drugged up because after walking home at 2 pm we fell asleep out of no where.   worst ramen experience.  also the kale salad is weak.  i really wanted to like it especially because the food scene in the area is dull.
1,This is a must-try for lunch in the heart of Times Square.
1,"First, the iced tea turned out to be am absolutely delicious Arnold Palmer. My caprese salad was a bit of a surprise, having arrived sitting on a bed of greens looking slightly underdressed. A bit of salt and pepper did the trick, and it was a nice spin on the traditional caprese salad that I did surprisingly enjoy. And then my pasta was a brilliant al dente. I love Malatesta."
0,"Be very careful if you are considering Palma for a private event.  We recently went to check out their ""Carriage House"" for an upcoming rehearsal dinner the night before our son's wedding.  In fairness, we did not have an appointment and just popped in on them.  When we were told that the person in charge was too busy to show us the space, we could not complain.  In her place, we were assigned a very knowledgeable -seeming young man.  It immediately became apparent that the carriage house would not be big enough for our party of 34. The gentleman then suggested the garden room which the carriage house connects to.  The garden room is lovely, and we were intrigued.  He told us that the minimum would be an $85.00 a head for a prix fixe meal, plus drinks, and a $500.00 fee for the room.  The room fee seemed low to us, but he stuck to it, even when I said, ""I'm glad to hear it is not $5000.00.""  We made one final attempt to deal with Jessica, the person in charge, but we were told that she was too busy to deal with us at that moment.  No problem.  We emailed her our request and were told flat out that the space was not available on Friday nights.  When we appealed, we were told that the price on a week night for the garden is $12000.00, plus food and drinks.  On a Friday night, the price would be $18-20,000.00.  Who are they kidding?  Palma is an okay restaurant. It is not Per Se.  Even so, though, if you are going to show potential customers around, you need to have at least the basic information.  $20,000,00 instead of $500.00?  Give me a break.  There are far better places at more reasonable prices to hold an event, and they are not all involved in bait and switch."
1,"I've been to Roberta's in New York, but I was also lucky enough to sample their pizzas at Bonnaroo this year.   I decided to have a late dinner at Roberta's pizza. Roberta's is located inside the Christmas Barn, which has air conditioning, is decked-out in twinkle lights and has a DJ. We tried the margarita pizza- one with pepperoni (which was actually salami), and one without. I don't know how Roberta's can make something so good so far away from their restaurant, but they totally do! This was an absolutely perfect pizza. We kept raving about their tomato sauce, which tasted fresh, plain and simple. What would I have to do to convince Roberta's to open up a location down in Nashville!? I LOVE Roberta's. Even at a festival!"
1,"Our group had several appetizers and various kabobs. Most of the food was very good to outstanding, some was not so well prepared. So, I'm settling on 'average' for the food rating. The appetizers were all either very good or outstanding. The sides with the main courses were outstanding. Unfortunately, the meat--cooked over charcoal--was too dry, i.e., over grilled. If the meat had not been the drawback, I would have overlooked that only a single element of the meal was disappointing. But, hey, it was that meat!"
1,"The atmosphere is great, and I loved that they have Gluten Free and Vegan options in their menu. Food is super yummi. Plus, the music selection + WIFI are perfect! Service is excellent all the workers are nice. The only thing that I would comment is that they don't have an espresso machine or a milk steamer, so their hot chocolate is not 'foamy.' Besides that, this place is amazing!"
1,"Didn't like it at all. Sandwiches in pictures are filled with meat, cheese, and some have lettuce. Not the ones I ordered. They were purposefully and thinly lined with salami and two to three squares of cheese.. It was more bread than anything. Girl behind the counter is sweet, but think this place will be out of business if sandwiches don't start representing the pictures. The guy who makes the sandwiches doesn't do a good job. Must be their friends who wrote these reviews. Disappointed."
1,"This is our family's regular take out place (Bella Via's pizza is a very close second) All the usual suspects are very good. Massaman curry, grilled shrimp, and the pork chops are all great along with the pas Thai."
0,"Amazing, everything thing about it is amazing. It is true NY, noisy, crowded, funky, and fun, simply wonderful. The wait staff is always great and the food to die for! My favorite is the horseradish salmon, and the lobster bisque."
1,"Always worth the wait, even at 5am. The pizza empanada is the real winner here. Love it with the green sauce!"
1,"I just stopped in to try their brunch and it was soooo good. My friend and I started with some of their Bloody Marys- a little spicy but in a good way. They have DIY Bloody Marys but mine would turn out like some sort of witch's brew so I left it up to the professionals. We then had the quince and yogurt. I have no idea what quince is, or what the fruit in the yogurt was but it was light and delicious. We then both had their take on an eggs benedict, with poached eggs, a lightly lemony hollandaise on a potato pancake with a very thin ham on it. Amazeballs. Our waiter was super attentive and enthusiastic without being overbearing. Love this place!"
1,"This place was ok-you can totally share a bowl with someone else!  I got a mix of everything and it was pretty spicy, which was nice!  Small dining area (just a few tables) and they open up the huge window when it's warm outside."
0,Wow the food in insane! So good worth the wait.
1,"It's absolutely amazing. It sucks that it changed from 5 pieces for $1 to 4 pieces, but whatever! I still love it to death. The pork and chive fried dumplings are made to perfection and so are the sesame/chive pancakes."
0,"This was just an awesome meal- totally deserving of 5 stars. I arrived before my bf and grabbed a drink at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and told me he'd make me something refreshing and if I didn't like it I could return it. He returned with a vodka gimlet- it was good but not amazing but he was so sweet I didn't want to offend him. My bf arrived and we were seated upstairs, a must unless you sit around the kitchen- and our waiter helped us pick out two glasses of wine. We started with the mushrooms- they were just the most unique dish- i've never had anything like it. We gave the waiter three choices of pastas and asked him to pick two and he surprised us with the spaghetti and the orechette. Both were superb. Some of the best pasta ever. Finished with the hazelnut torta. We were orgasming the whole time. Perfect date night & perfect food. Highly recommend."
1,"I took my wife there for a great date night in our neighborhood.  What  a gem!  We had a great meal, discovered some amazing wine, were treated like royalty, and found enough different items on the menu that we are absolutely going to return. Oysters on the Half Shell - We sampled three varieties, and settled on our favorite.  At $1.50 each, they were cheaper here than at other places we've been to in the West Village.  But as a New Englander, I know there is only one true way to savor raw oysters - with cocktail sauce, tobasco, horseradish, and lemon.  Joseph Leonard uses a fancier, but ultimately less satisfying (vinegar/soy?) type sauce.   Salad with Grapefruit/Avocado and a light citrus vinagrette - Quite simply, one of the best salads we've ever tasted.  Very light, delicate greens and super fresh avocado and grapefruit. Bronzino fish - the night's special was a boned fish, which was served with the full skin/body still on.  Best meal of the evening.  Succulent and delicious! Skate wing - not as good as the Bronzino, but still pretty good.  Served on a light bed of greens with some citrus drizzle on the plate.  Yum. The staff was amazingly helpful, which is kind of rare.  We received a little tasting from the chef, which we enjoyed!   We're going to return for some more of the Smith and Smith Syrah/Cab blend wine and a cheese tasting."
1,"I love this brunch spot. I'm rarely in the area though, so I look forward to planning a brunch date here when the opportunity presents itself (good friends who appreciate food). FOOD - Ricotta with burnt orange toast and truffle honey. I don't care what the food snobs say, but I love truffle infused honey and oil. I still regret not buying that delicious truffle honey in London's Borough Market, but I digress. We ran out of the toast and they refilled it gratis. - Trofie with pesto, pine nuts, gaeta olives and fagiolini. It was delicious and had a good deal of fresh produce mixed in. I'm a HUGE fan of pine nuts. - Homemade pork sausage. Can't really good wrong with this. Great for sharing. - Veal Agnolotti with pancetta, spinach and rosemary. The portion size was smaller, e.g. not oversized! Very fresh. - Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with blueberries and meyer lemon curd. Nicely executed for the pancake lovers. - Scampi and Grits with polenta, tomato, sausage and coddled eggs. A nice egg alternative to the other egg dish. Delish. SERVICE Service is fantastic. It is not obtrusive at all and they don't pressure you to finish up and leave. Reservations are smart, as the wait is crazy at times. And they seat incomplete parties :)"
0,This is one of the best burgers you will find in NYC for under $10. The menu is simple and the service is quick. My only gripe is the size of the bathroom. Sometimes when the place is crowded the line can be irritatingly long. In my opinion it is definitely worth trying.
1,"Loved this place!  My girlfriend and I are foodies and cooks, and were really impressed with this place.  We both had the California Burger, which is a mushroom based patty with a sweet onion relish, avocado, and cashew cheese on a soft whole wheat bun.  The french fries and side salad were also delicious.  We sat in the lovely backyard outdoor space.  Will definitely be going back."
0,Seriously the best Thai experience I've had.  The waitresses are all really cool and very hands on without being too hands on.  The chefs actually bring the food to your table.  The prices are totally reasonable and I love the Thai pop soundtrack playing in the background.  Oh yeah and the food is great as well.  The only downside is you'll never find it unless you're really looking for it.
1,"Cute crepe joint imported from Japan.  This is the second location they opened. Quite an extensive menu with savory and sweet options.  Very reasonably priced.  Some of the sweet crepes were just $7.  Get the one with chocolate truffles!  As log as you like either chocolate or berries,you really can't go wrong with any choice I think.   It's a pretty good size and they have the special crepe cone holder with ridges so you can peel as you eat.   My only wish is that they can make the crepe warmer somehow.  I know... Being to picky.  Maybe for the savory versions they will be able to keep it warm longer.  They only have two stools inside so it's more of a pickup and go kind of place."
1,"Ate here yesterday for lunch with a friend & really loved the food. I had the ""meat medley"" hand pulled noodles in soup & my friend had the vegetable hand-shaved pan fried noodles. Both dishes were excellent, especially for about $6 a piece. The service, however, was really disappointing. It took a really long time for the server to take our order, and then about 45 minutes later she came back & said she lost the ticket. We never received our drinks, and also never received a check. So we put down more than enough money to cover it, and left. Kind've a bummer, but once we actually received the food we were very very happy. I would definitely recommend it for the value & taste, but not if you're in a hurry or worried about attentive service."
1,"Hu has put a lot of effort into branding and the interior of the restaurant.  both are amazing... if only they put as much effort into the *food*.  we had breakfast for two - was rather on the expensive side and not very good.  (my dining companion called it ""not bad"" - which is not really a compliment when it comes to food.)  food was boring and bland."
0,Excellent. The fried chicken was juicy and spiced just right. We also had the banana cream pie which was delicious.
0,found gum and hair in my dish and i even saw them use the water fountain water to clean the grill don't they know homeless people and god knows what else go in that water uhhh never again will i eat there not even if somebody gave me 100$ to eat there i would not do it...
0,"Started our lunch off with some TOTS for the table, absolutely delicious. I ordered the retro burger and I have to admit, this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. Served on a toasted english muffin, the blend of meat inside was so tasty my mouth is watering right now thinking about it. The staff was incredibly friendly and fun and the beer choices were perfect. Thanks to Gust for the amazing hospitality, great drinks and mouth watering food!"
0,"I live a block up from this neighbor restaurant in Greenpoint. The chef is magnificent and the food without exception has never disappointed both in quality and presentation. The staff however is cold and has little regard for customer service starting with the ice queen hostess who in seven months I have yet seen smile or say ""thank you"" We have eaten there a dozen times in recent months because the food is so good and it's very convenient, each time it is as if they have never seen us before. Last week I invited guests for a business dinner, the waitress came to our table to take a drink order, 15 minutes later we asked a second waiter to check on the status. (there were six patrons in the restaurant) The same waitress comes back and says ""may I take your drink order"" with an attitude that we had to ask another staff member to locate her, forgetting completely that we had placed an order prior. It's a shame as others in the neighborhood all feel the same way and collectively would all frequent Anella's more often, but elect not to as a result of the ""we don't care about you""  staff's attitude. The talented kitchen staff and great food deserves a better and more appreciative customer focused staff."
0,The place should be chopped.  Over rated.  Our food table of 6 came out Cold. Both app and dinner.  Over priced.  Dessert was good but the gelato was melting before I was able to eat it. Not coming back place is a joke.
0,"Best bar in the EV!  Great music, great staff, great vibes!"
0,"The food is very good, and at these reasonable prices an excellent deal. The drink specials, from unlimited Sangria brunch to Mojito Madness Mondays ($5 Mojitos), make this a great destination for fun gatherings. Above all, the service is stellar! Twice I've been here with challenging parties (one, a group of 16 all drinking for brunch, and the other a party of 12 where 6 canceled only a few minutes before the reservation time) and both times experienced gracious, friendly service from waiters who really made the whole experience. I really like the food. I really like the drinks. I really like the prices. I LOVE the service and the big group-friendly set up. Highly recommend, especially for large groups."
0,"So 3 friends and i decided to skip over Elote for brunch today and travel on down Union Ave to go to Jimmys. We get there and are all settled in enjoying ourselves. I personally ordered the ""Mr. Potato Head"" sandwich which costs 6$. We are all eating and half way through my sandwich i bite into a sickle shaped piece of glass that was lodged in my food. I pull the piece of glass out of my mouth and notify the server. He takes it and talks to the chef. Says he would comp my sandwich only. Which would normally be okay if i just found it in my food and didn't eat it. I eventually realize my tongue is bleeding and now its gone from mistake and problem avoided to slice and possible infection in my mouth. I ask that the owner please come down so we can talk about the meal and what happened and that it has gone from avoided problem to potential serious health risk. The owner(Blair) is not only headstrong about what happened saying that its just ""unfortunate"" but she refuses to comp the meal of the 3 other people that were at my table, keep in mind the entire bill was maybe 40$. The other patrons that were with me had lost their appetite  after I had found the glass in my food...as all our meals were prepared together in the kitchen. The owner exclaimed to me that this is the first time this has ever happened and shes sorry. If its the first time something like that has ever happened....on mere principle the entire meal should be comped. Again which was a total of $40. Its not about the money but it seems to me the owner should be willing to eat a mere $40 bill if one of their customers starts bleeding from eating their food. Not only did we have to pay but now i have to be concerned for my health. Horrible customer service Jimmy's Diner. Horrible. You have now lost 4 customers because of your poor service attitude and your inability to pay us all respect and take care of the simple $40 bill."
0,the best new york slice i've ever had. you can taste delicious olive oil in every savory bite. the square slices are doughy and crunchy. everything has a perfect char.
0,The food was good but the service is not so good. They take forever to come to the table
0,"I was checking out the free magazine Chopsticks NY and found Sake Bar(Hagi). So my husband & I went to check it out last night. At first we wasn't sure where it was, but then you had to walk down a flight of steps. Once there, you have to leave your name and wait. I would say its about a 20 minute wait because it was packed, but in a good way. After 20 mins, we were seated and greeted by friendly staff. Looking through the menu, the prices are affordable and choices of food goes a long way. There's something for everyone. My husband had a tofu dish that was topped with cheese and a side of bean curd. Very delicious. I had chicken on skewers and a fried rice ball w Miso sauce, so so good. For drinks we tried the Beer Punch(cocktail) and that was good too. I also tried a Sake that our staffer suggested and I enjoyed it. For dessert we had vanilla ice cream with the red bean topping. That was good too. In a nutshell, after the first time going there, I would go back. I loved the food/drink, the atmosphere and for the price you can't go wrong here."
1,"Have had a very good dinner & a meh-brunch here, though the thing they have in common is lame service.  Feeling a little guilty over a measly 17% tip at dinner since the food was quite good, but I just couldn't get over how absentee, spacey & pretty curt our waiter(s) were. Anywho, had some good quality & good value starters @ $5 a pop for the shishito peppers & deviled eggs, both great.  Little neck clams were good, though lots of fat left on the not-quite-rendered pork product co-mingled with the clams & squash.  Squid salad was good & even better once we added salt, pepper & lemon.  It was almost like the chef forgot to dress the salad. Split a main course that was a glorified white fish with some pesto bean salad underneath.  Fine, plain, typical. Brunch was not good, which was surprising after all the positive reviews. Scrambl was overcooked, looked so lonely on the plate, filled with lackluster vegis & borderline 'off' smoked salmon.  Coffee refills were extremely hard to come by.  had to beg for water refills at both brunch & dinner.  Is there a shortage on NYC tap?"
0,Rice and beans rice and beans rice and beans. I can eat them all day every day and if I could I would eat them from cafe habana every day. BEST CUBAN FOOD EVERRR. It's all good. Cute restaurant with fun art on the walls. The corn is good. The drinks are good. The rice and beans are GOOD
0,"When I heard that this wine bar was opened by staff affiliated with Le Bernardin, I knew that I would be in for a treat and it did not disappoint.   Went here on a late Saturday afternoon to catch up with girlfriends and the subdued, casual environment was a great backdrop for conversation.  We all found small plates to enjoy (the duck banh-mi is AMAZING) and found the waiters extremely helpful with wine selection.  In fact, they encouraged us to have different tastings before making our final selection and they have quite an extensive collection of wines by the glass.  Given that wines outnumber food options by 2:1, this is definitely a place for wine (and beer) drinkers. If you want to come here, the waiter says that the weekends are less crowded than weekdays."
1,"Love this place! There seem to be a bunch of empanada places popping up, but this place is the real deal. They serve whole grain, white flour and corn empanadas with a great variety of fillings for the health conscious or those seeking comfort food. There's something for everyone. Oh, and they have a delicious hot sauce that you can have on the side. You can check it out here: empanadascafe.com/menu.h… Tips: It's a really small store front don't go with expectations to dine in. If there is some table space, you're lucky.  If not, take yours to go. Don't miss the great dessert empanadas and home made ice cream pops. It's cash only."
0,"Good food, but horrible service. My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner. Our waitress took my order and walked away to help other tables without taking my husband's order or asking if we wanted anything else. We have been here before and know the portions are big, but we did not want the same thing to eat and figured we would take the leftovers with us. About 10 minutes later, we were finally able to get her back to our table. We told her we were not done ordering. She seemed shocked, but took our oder anyway. My dish came out much sooner than my husband's, so I had to sit there waiting for his late order to come out. Once we received our meals, there was another couple beside us that had just arrived. They had never been there before, so our waitress explained to them that the portions are very large, ""As you can see."" and gestured at us. She stated it in a way that we were crazy for ordering that much food. Who cares as long as we pay for our food?! The horrible service put a damper on the entire evening. I will not be returning to Carmine's."
0,The wine menu was exquisite. The service was impeccable and we did not have much trouble making a reservation for our party of 4.  The after dinner treats that the Gramercy Tavern sent us home with were wonderful.  Pricey but the food is worth it.
1,"This place has some great vegetarian take out. They are quick with delivery and store you address in their computer to make it even quicker. The food is good, but not all dishes are great. The pad thai is not so great. In general, a great addition to the neighborhood but may fail to win over meat eaters."
0,Amazing discovery! It was intimate and the service was exceptional! It was a memorable experience.
1,Love love love the pizza and the atmosphere. Super family friendly. Service is great. Great place for a get-together with family and friends. You cannot leave the restaurant without getting their ice cream. That is an absolutely must!

1,"Awesome BBQ place, live music, decent prices, friendly staff! The Brisket is out of this world!!! Only complains are that they seem to only have one restroom and they only take cash. Otherwise I would give this place 5 stars!"
0,"Can't wait for the fad to dissipate! For a few weeks, Two Hands was a place where you could calmly read your morning paper while enjoying a cup of coffee. Victim of its success, the place is now cashing in on a crowd desperate to get a seat to quickly (they'll kick you out after a while) ingurgitate the (pricey) food. Too bad, the whitewashed design (successfully borrowed from Happy Bones and Dimes) and the nice vintage touches (Stanley&Sons aprons, Mason jars) made it appear like a good neighborhood coffee shop."
1,This is a great neighborhood staple. I've been coming here for a long time and everytime it's good. It dos get very crowded so I do recommend making a reservation.
0,"Very reliable quality here. Pub food at its best. I ate here for many years and never had an issue with the quality of the food.  And that is a big deal considering the main thing I ate was the cheeseburger - ground meat is notorious for its ability to get people.  So in my opinion, that speaks to the cleanliness and the freshness of the food that they server. Beyond that,the food is remarkable consistent, and consistently good.  The specials that change nightly mix things up nicely, and the service is excellent.  The specials often vary into the higher end range, thick steaks and seafood dishes that can hit the mid $20 range, but the price is worth the cost if you are inclined to a fancier meal, Tavern on Jane can nail a rib-eye steak as easily as they slam dunk a cheeseburger.  And don't forget what is quite possibly the best potato au gratin you might ever get.  I haven't seen it topped, and I have been around and love me some PaG.  Do not miss that. It can get crowded and on occasion they do find themselves with a bit of a crunch, but overall i give the service a A for effort and a B+ for execution on those times when they get overly busy...it is a fine balance for any restaurant to walk with staffing.  I don't usually knock off for service unless it is rude or indifferent.  That is not the case here at all, the servers are polite at all times...when they are busy you might have to wave them down.   The music levels are low and unobtrusive, TVs are kept with no sound and if you want to avoid them altogether, there is a backroom seating area devoid of the screens. Beer on draft changes on occasion, with Guinness a constant.  Bartenders know their stuff, the fireplace is nice in the winter, there are west village characters about and in general, is a great place to go for the casual dinner/late night drinks."
0,"This was the most incredible meal I have ever had! My girlfriend and I went here for our anniversary, and we couldn't have been happier with Gramercy Tavern.  The service was incredible.  When we were on our way to the restaurant, we got caught in a thunderstorm without an umbrella, so we were thoroughly soaked when we got to the restaurant.  When we got there, the hostess was very nice, and even offered my girlfriend a pashmina shawl to keep her from getting cold in the dining room. The staff had everything down to a science.  The timing between the courses was perfect, so that we had time to talk and never felt rushed, but we were never just tapping our fingers on the table waiting for the next course. We ordered off of the 3 course prix-fixe menu, and the food was superb.  I had duck for the main course, and she had lamb, and both were prepared very well.  The portions were very well sized, so that by the end of the night we were both full to bursting.  One thing we really liked was that they added in lots of little surprises along the way (little bite sized palette cleansers and appetizers and things like that), so a 3 course meal was a lot more like 7. I couldn't recommend Gramercy Tavern any more.  It was a great experience from start to finish!"
0,"BEST PIZZA EVER. Definitely only allowed to cheat here a couple of times a year, it is not for the flat belly conscious but it is the GREATEST pizza of all times!!!!!!!!! Very expensive, but worth every penny!!!"
0,"I've lived in NYC for 8 years now and have been trying different sushi places all over the city during this time. Even though great new/expensive sushi places come (and sometimes go), I still think Sushi Yasuda is the best one I've been to for the freshest/tastiest sushi outside of Tokyo. Always the right combination of rice, soy sauce, wasabi paired with very fresh fish. I prefer to always sit at the bar whenever possible. Also, for the quality of sushi that you get, this place is a relative bargain. I work nearby so try to go here for lunch or dinner every month or so."
1,"I been here more then I can count and every experience has been amazing. From the fresh fish selection to the sides and the complimentary dessert. I love the ambiance of the Astoria location but this location is the only one that serves Mussels in tomato sauce with crumbled feta on top. Best I had in a long time and the portion is huge, definitely worth a try."
1,"This is a must for anyone who enjoys their food! The staff are friendly and so welcoming. Atmosphere is relaxed and really enjoyable. Definitely worth trying the fish taco, earth chili, and for dessert the triple T!"
0,"I don't understand people who complain in a neighborhood where this guys have put such a nice investment and everything else is just crappy..please..the food is great the atmosphere is mellow and warm and the service is professional, love Le Barricou!"
1,Great burgers and great prices! Hands down the best truffle burger in the city.  See my review for Umami Burger.
1,"Mad props to Irene Y. for recommending this place =D  It's totally out in the middle of nowhere (ie. Red Hook), but absolutely worth the journey out there.  The dumplings were FANTASTIC and not at all what you'd expect upon first glance - tender meat and flavor that really stood out.  I've had literally hundreds of Chinese dumplings from several places in Manhattan Chinatown, SF Chinatown, etc. and though tasty, they just don't quite compare.  The Korean Steak and Eggs was also crazy delicious, namely the steak =D  Grilled to perfection and so rare and goooooooood!  Service was exceptional, ambiance is indeed romantic, and I'd also recommend Good Fork for a great date venue. Ahh dumplings + steak = mad win!"
0,"Delivery people are scam artists who claim they dont have change  to give out. Guess that means you can 1) leave without a tip or 2) go back to the store and get some bills. Come on, this is a scam that immoral drivers run. I know because i worked delivery and you NEVER leave without a stack of bills. When i called the store i was aked to ""change my tone"" which means the manager is aware of it or even in on it. Never order from here, ever."
0,"If you want to try a good open culinary food market you shouldn't try Urbanspace in the 33rd street between Broadway and 6th avenue. It was the first time, so I was happy to go there. The first thing that surprised me was the diversified selection food you can choose.The staff looked very friendly and helpful. But I was quickly disappointed when I saw the price, 9 dollars for a small steak sandwich an a coke Its too expansive !! It was not enough because I still hungry after eaten. It's absolutely not a great value for your money. I definitely not recommend this place mainly if you are a student like me."
0,"I love this place!  Every time I go to NY, I have to make a stop here for some great food!  Lots of variety and every single thing I've ordered was good.  The cuban is my favorite, but like I mentioned, everything is good here.  Be sure to stop by and get yourself a snack.  There are lots of other great restaurants in the same neighborhood so it's a good place to familiarize yourself with."
0,"Went for Valentine's Day.  I guess that serves me right: sometimes V-Day prix fixe meals in NYC can be a rip-off.  And this one was.  Very small servings for $125/person without any bread or even a glass of prosecco.  Chicken was good but NOTworth $125/person.  Courses in between were 2 sunchokes per person.  And the beets were miniscule--definitely not for sharing.  Beets, chicken, sunchokes, gnocchi--are not worth that price.   Waitstaff, however, is excellent and very attentive.  The flavors were great, but definitely feels like a small-plates restaurant, like Tertulia.  Overpriced, small portions.  They have a good idea there if they can appreciate their customer a bit more.  Otherwise, not a place to go twice."
1,"I don't speak a single word of Spanish. The Dominican women behind the counter, their aprons on, their hands digging into the pots overflowing plates of beans, rice and stew, they knew. It was obvious. A woman put the platter in front of me and raised an eyebrow. I smiled. She didn't. Well, I didn't mind. I sat at the counter and attacked my plate like I had never seen food before. The rice and beans melted in my mouth. The beef stew fell apart before I could touch it. The baked chicken was the juiciest I've ever had. The flavors were brilliant, succulent and satisfying. Ten minutes later, my friends nudged their leftovers around their plate, held their stomachs and groaned. Not me. I scraped off every last grain of rice and licked my lips. I didn't need to speak a word of Spanish. It didn't matter. The Dominican ladies and I exchanged smiles. They knew what I meant. It was obvious."
1,"Sometimes NYC yelp reviews are so fucking weird because people will be like, ""omg, the service was amazing, the food blew my mind, I loved the atmosphere...but I saw my ex-boyfriend here so I'm giving this dump two stars."" My point is: I tried to dump my boyfriend at Roberta's once, but the food is so good and we love it so much that we keep going back despite the bad memory. I like the backyard area and the mulled wine is a fine winter treat. The service is super friendly and the menu is exciting and seasonal. Roberta's is a class above the rest in the ongoing local dining movement. Two words: urban farming."
0,I tried the lamb meatball with mushroom sauce and the pork with regular tomato sauce. Both were excellent.
1,"took one star off because there are not really vegetarian options. otherwise, i love you Mew."
1,"It's a long line...but, it's straight to the point (order, eat, enjoy).  No frills."
1,"Came here for Restaurant Week last week with a large group of people (8 people) and it was fantastic!   We had a slight problem with the reservation so they gave us all complimentary pink campaign (that's the way to my heart!).  Also, they sat us at a round table which is great for a large party. The views are amazing on the river which makes for a cool atmosphere.   The Restaurant Week deal was phenomenal b/c you can order off the full menu (with a surcharge on certain items) but this allows for many more choices than offered at most RW restaurants! The portions were also larger than most restaurant's RW deal.  I had the burrata cheese appetizer which was delicious and large! And the tomato pasta which was a little al dente but really tasty and fresh as well!! The service was also great.  They did not rush us along at all which was perfect for a group of friends getting together to catch up and enjoy each others company.  I really enjoyed the relaxed pace. Overall a wonderful experience - especially for Restaurant Week!! I would highly recommend it!"
1,"I know I'm in the minority but I was a little underwhelmed with GO! GO!  Here are the things I thought needed improvement: 1)  TOO DRY.  I ordered the pork katsu curry and I think they majorly skimped on the amount of curry sauce.  I like my food DROWNING in curry.  I guess they want you to spend the money to get ""extra curry"", which is lame.  Curry House in LA is much more generous with the curry. 2) MISSING PINK RADISH.  For some reason, the radish was missing from the dish, which made me sad.  The radish gives the dish a pop of color, which is needed.  I like the taste of the pink radish too. 3) FREEZING IN THERE!!!!  I don't know what was the deal the day I went to GO GO!   But it was frickin'  FREEZING in there!  TURN ON THE HEAT, YO!  Having to eat a dinner with your winter jacket on is never fun. The two stars go to the friendly cashier, but I would not go out of my way for this place.  I think they're so popular because they do not have any competition!"
0,"Really loved this place, food was great. service good and a nice feel. They are a bit pretentious on reservations but it wasn't too bad."
1,Phenomenal service. Incredible drinks. Delicious food.
0,"wow, what  a night... a lady recomended this cozzy spot in tribeca so i said we should check it out together.. must say it was great idea.  by far the most creative drink menu i have ever seen.. def try the tequila drink... and the gin drink.. both excellent..   excited to go back as i was told the menu changes often , cant wait to see what they will have next time.   chicken is chicken right? wrong!! i ordered the chicken for 2 and ate it all to my self... was a very large portion.. great.. will be going back to this spot for sure.. i almost wanted to keep it a secret.. but what the hell.. enjoy!"
1,"i would stick to the appetizers. they stole the show. beautiful presentation, tasted better than the entrees, which bring them down to 3.5 stars.  also, appetizers on the large size, entrees on the small. --------------------------------------------------­-------- STARTERS: Baba Ghannouj (1) - really sour. didn't finish. no likey. Summer Chankleesh (4) - watermelon and herby crumbly cheese. very sweet watermelon. paired well with mint. Sweet Corn and Cheese (5) - haloumi melted on a hot skillet topped with corn. yummy! Kusa Bi Laban (4) - zucchini spaghetti. love. slivers of zucch + fresh cherry tomatoes in a sea of salty garlicky foam. a bit toO salty. Spicy Octopus (4) - not chewy! cooked very well. not spicy ): Da'ud Basha (4) - lamb meatball. great tomato based sauce. meat a bit dry. Green Beans (4) - really like the sweet sesame sauce. Artichoke (3.5) - very sour white tahini sauce. nice and minty. but artichoke a bit..stringy/tough pita was poofy, but kinda dry/stale tasting. very thin. i prefer fluffy and doughy. personal preference, though. CONCLUSION: (4 stars) photo-worthy plating. some dishes too salty. overall very good. --------------------------------------------------­-------- ENTREES: Chicken Shish Taouk (2) - nice char-grilled taste while maintaining juiciness. tasted boring. big heap of greens on the side. just greens. no dressing or anything. served on a soggy something that i suspect is suppose to be crunchy. or at least toasty. Striped Bass (3) - good fish. small. served on slice of baguette that was kinda soggy. clams were juicy.   Angel Hair Fatte (4)- a bittt too salty. love the crumbly pita bits + pine nuts. pasta a bit too soft/overcooked. otherwise, my favorite entree. Yahknit al Khawkh (4) - lamb and plum stew. verrrry soft braised meat. topped with 2 small slices of fruit. no real fruit flavor. or any other particular flavor. didn't stand out to me. but still very well made. CONCLUSION: (3.5 stars) boring. not executed well enough. --------------------------------------------------­-------- DESSERTS: Pistachio Ice Cream (1) - can i give zero stars? GROSS. tasted like SOAP. flowery soap. only hint that it may be pistachio is the green color. avoid avoid avoid. Ashta (2) - lebanese clotted cream. vvvverry interesting texture. looked like ice cream, but thick and...mushy instead of creamy. also tasted like...flowers. not in a good way. Awaimat (3)- beignet. good. dense fried doughnut in syrup. nothing spectacular. Candy Bar (5) - like a fancy Crunch bar. fudgy chocolate on a crispy crunchy base. VERY good. love the fig caramel mouse. CONCLUSION: (3 stars) hit or miss. choose wisely. also, everything topped with pistachios"
0,Not as good as the cart experience. Used to love it because it was street food. Now i'm confused if it's a done kebeb spot or a wendys. Looks nice and food is solid but it's missing that street vibe.
1,"The lunch special, scallion beef, was delicious but small. I left hungry."
1,"Supersize my balls! LOL, sorry. I giggle like a little girl everytime I say it. TIP: they do NOT take reservations, so make sure to get there early if you have a larger party or want a decent table. This place is pretty awesome. You can pick & choose the type of meatball, sauce, and sides as you wish. I got the ""everything but the kitchen sink salad"" with beef meatballs and spicy meat sauce (which was NOT spicy at all). The dish itself was really filling and I'm glad I got this entree instead of of just the naked balls (seemed like the portions were bigger). Unless you get there early, you're most likely going to have to wait. My two friends and I went at 6:30pm on a Friday night, and we got an outdoor table which worked for us since one of my friends brought her toddler baby along. The restaurant itself is small, and it feels much smaller since it's always packed. Our server was alright, but we had to remind her several times to service us correctly. Overall, I had a good experience because my entree was pretty tasty."
1,"Best falafel in the city by far! Pita bread is home made, falafel are crispy and flavorful, veggies and sauce really distinguish the sandwich. If you ask for everything you will get some spicy additions so be careful and enjoy!! Cash only"
0,"Excellent food, excellent wine list and a great value.  I miss the old Sanford's (the 80's decorated, sorta old and dingy looking place that served ridiculously amazing food) but the new place is much nicer.  It's an elegant atmosphere but with a comfortable feel.  Their balsamic dressings is hands down the best, I think I could drink it if they sold it in bottles (not really, but it's good).  If they offer the filet as a special, get it.  It's from a butcher shop near by and it is awesome."
0,"First review I have ever written, but I felt compelled. This was the BEST hummus and Babaganoush I have ever had. So flavorful and savory! To top it off the service was great and quick. Highly recommend if you are looking for delicious meal"
1,I had the weekday brunch. The server recommended the vegan scramble (even though I'm a firm omnivore) it was delicious & the perfect counter to the several Old Fashioned cocktails I indulged in yesterday. The atmosphere is relaxed & I could write my journal without feeling rushed. I'll be back to try the waffles- I had some serious food envy.
1,"Fantastic food, Wine, Service, and clientele. This restaurant is the perfect place for a date or celebratory occasion. Best time to go is when its snowing and the skylight is filling up with snow."
1,A no frills dive-bar in Williamsburg. The ambiance is definitely hipster. You get free cheese balls and tiwzzlers which is cool. Drinks are pretty inexpensive (I got a shot of Whiskey for $4). Not really my type of scene but the overall atmosphere was very chill.
1,"This place is a gem in my neighborhood. Great food at a great price. I love getting their micheladas during brunch. I have been here about 3,4 times, and I have always had a very pleasant experience. I usually get their guacamole + chips as an appetizer and then have 3 tacos as my entree. The place is small, so the wait staff is pretty attentive. I have friends staying with me in a few weeks, so I will definitely bringing them here for brunch. Their food is consistently good, and I have never been let down."
1,"solid italian ... however, i just ordered $80 worth of delivery -- 4 mains, 2 salads ... i got TWO tiny pieces of bread.  i guess you have to ask for it!  kinda crazy if you ask me."
1,This is my new found favorite lobster roll place. Taste way better than the SAMs chowder here in the Bay Area. I think like needs to open one up in the Bay Area. Love lobster!!!!!
0,This place is awesome and it is my current go to spot for real Greek cuisine.  Everything we tried here reminded me of eating in Greece.  The place is tiny so you really need to call ahead and get a reservation unless you don't mind sitting at the community table.
1,"Favorite place to go, always get brunch there.  It's kind of pricy but one can always pick a cheaper option that is still great.  Introduced me to chilaquiles and now I'm obsessed/obese. (bad pun)"
0,"beautiful cafe and nice staff but coffee is burnt every time i go there. also, the food is so-so."
0,They survive on past glories.  Not exactly my 'slice of pizza'.
1,"Pepe Rosso To Go is a great place to try if you are in the area, and have a place to sit and enjoy the food (there is VERY limited seating within the place). I went here several weeks ago, and left fully satisfied and full of delicious food! I can't remember exactly what I had order, outside of the fact that it was a special of the day. It was in a tomato sauce, which I found enjoyable, but not quite the greatest tomato sauce I have ever had. However, my co-worker had order the Rigatoni Prosciutto De Parma Arugula in a pink sauce and would highly recommend this dish! The pink sauce definitely makes this dish and thought it was one of the better pink sauces I have ever had."
1,So me and the Mr. Just left this spot...we've passed by many times and today were hungry and felt like spanish food so we went in.  Thankfully were just in time for HAPPY HOUR!!!! $5 Sangria and Empanadas for $1...who can complain about that! The place has a very cool decor and vibe and the workers were super nice...I ordered the pork chops with fried yuca...the pork was  very well seasoned.  My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak with rice and beans also well seasoned and the steak was cooked perfectly. We prayed to the food Gods for a good meal and our prayers we answered!  I really had a good experience overall and would totally recommend this place!
0,Sticky's is the shizz! Fingers for LIFE! xo
1,"One of the most frequent questions I get asked is which is the best Thai restaurant in NY.  Honestly, most of them do not impress me at all.  They all seem to adapt their cooking to a Western palate, instead of sticking to authentic Thai cuisine.  (My family used to be in the Thai restaurant business, so I have a pretty good idea.) So I almost never go!  Prefer to cook it at home.  However, I went to Sripraphai many years ago, and remembered it being one of the places I did like.  I finally returned again a few weeks ago, to see if it lives up to the hype. I went with a few friends who were pretty happy with everything.  I enjoyed the food, but some things were off.  For example, I ordered the khao soi, a dish that I love to eat when I visit Chiang Mai.  There are eateries dedicated to that one dish!  The Sripraphai version looked similar, but the taste wasn't.  It was a curry, but not the same paste that should be used; it seemed peanut-buttery, in fact, so that really threw me off.  The ingredients that come on the side were right, but that still didn't save the dish.  (To be fair, they may not be able to get that curry--I have searched high and low and haven't found it anywhere in NY.  I just have to beg people to pick it up for me when they happen to be in Chiang Mai.) The other dishes we got weren't too bad, but the seasoning could have been executed better.  For example, the duck salad (yum ped)--I prefer it more balanced between the sweet, sour, and salty; this was overwhelmingly sweet to me.  (This tends to be a major complaint of mine when I eat at Thai restaurants--the food always tends to be sweet and that's not how it's made in Thailand!) As to the service, I thought it was fine.  The decor is nice, it was clean and cheerful.  Also, the fridge by the front door is filled with all kinds of sweet goodies!  I don't have the patience to make Thai desserts at home, save for sticky rice and mango. So I think the place is worth the trip.  And while I only gave it three stars, it is one of the better Thai places in NYC.  I will definitely come back again, so that I can try some other dishes."
0,Best drunk food ever!!!
0,"This was my first time there with a friend. I ordered the Kakuni (pork belly) and the Akamaru ramen. Decor - The place was pretty nice. Didn't at all feel like a ramen place (but I guess in a good way). We were seated at this bench which strangely enough was in front of a mirror so from time to time my friend and I would be staring into a mirror (which was a little odd while eating). 4/5 stars Service - Waiter/waitresses were great. Filled up my water without asking. Food came promptly and they always greeted us with a smile. 5/5 stars Food - I don't know about anyone else but does the food kind of remind you of Chinese food? The pork belly appetizer was very tasty. Came with 2 pieces of braised pork belly and 2 halved soy marinated hard boiled eggs. Honestly, if you served this was served to me in another restaurant my first thought would have been ""oh...Chinese braised pork with soy eggs"". Regardless though, it tasted pretty good. The Akamaru ramen was pretty good. Noodles actually is pretty similar to the ones they have at Minca. Noodles seem fresh and had good chewiness to them. Normally I don't associate these noodles with traditional ramen noodles but it was tasty. Amount of noodles was a tad on the light side. Didn't care too much for the slices of pork on the side (there were 2 thin slices). The saving grace as others have put it was the broth. It was flavorful yet it had this really light feel to it. I'm not completely sold on it yet but strangely I nearly drank most of it (which I NEVER do). The main reason is because I hate feeling super thirsty afterwards (which I am feeling now). 4/5 stars I'm not 100% sure I can rate this place over Setagaya (probably need to try it at least one more time) and honestly I haven't tried Mitsuwa so I don't have a great comparison for best ramen joint in NYC. At least this place in my opinion is better than Rai Rai Ken, Minca and Momofuku."
0,One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. Can't wait to go back. Delicious open crab ravioli with razor clams and escarole And mind blowing Quail with beets and cranberry sauce. SO AMAZIN
0,"Mac & cheese is delicious. Also, this place is great for meeting friends and splitting a bottle of wine. It can get loud, but just shoot for the tables in the back."
0,Great sicilian pizza
0,"Fried food and tasty sauces.  What more can you ask for to cap off a long night? Okay, if the fries came with a slice of pizza that might make it a bit better. As is common with late night type stands, you may very well run into a pretty long wait.  The snack is worth the wait."
0,"Oh Diner, what happened to you? You got OK from Bordain and said- shit I don't need to try anymore? Disappointed"
0,"Okay. I knew the place opened at noon on Wednesdays so I thought I would get there close to that so I wouldn't have to wait long. That was a good idea. I had a square slice ($4) and I saw Dom make it in front of me, I saw the pizza go in the oven and I saw it come out and him cut a healthy amount of basil on top. About 15-20 minutes from order to mouth. I thought the slice was really very good. Maybe the best I've ever had. I wanted another but there was no room in my gut. I did wait another, oh.... 10 minutes? for a slice to take home to my husband. I will go back there with friends. It is one block of the Q train at the Avenue J stop. Easy to find."
1,"If you are looking for a cheap and healthy plan in this area, this is the place to go. The whole chicken dishes can easiliy feed 4 persons."
1,The waitress was very friendly and personal. Everything we ate was delicious and I plan on going back. You have got to try the margarita ice cubes! It was a great experience.
0,"Cafe Habana is one of the best spots to eat at in the city! I really love this place, the delivery speed is lightning fast, customer service is on point and most important the food is GREAT! I suggest that you get the blackened chicken its a great dish!"
0,"Fun, friendly environment! Family style meals make the evening more entertaining and easier to share with everyone."
1,You don't end up with 370 reviews raving about this place for nothing.  I was craving chicken rice and this place delivered. The roti was delicious as well.  My boyfriend and 8 I got two rice plates (better for just two people)  and the sauteed string beans with shrimp paste.  This place did not disappoint!
1,"This is a neighborhood gem with a killer wine list to boot. My friends and I had a great time sipping on Malbec and munching on little mushroom risotto puffs and crispy brie. The seating area in the back has couches and walls lined with board games and books; Jadis is great for both small groups and dining solo. In addition to their impressive wine selection, Jadis has small French-inspired plates as well as larger entrees and desserts. It's on a quiet strip near Rivington and Essex but it gets louder and more packed as the night goes on."
1,"always in a food coma after leaving this place. the chicken is great, and affordable. pies are good too, but a little on the expensive side in my opinion. my key lime slices always seem so small for that price tag! but i still can't resist. i will also say the service is pretty blah. and the hush puppies are NOTHING like real Southern hush puppies, i was pretty disappointed about that. otherwise, YUM!"
0,"I'm not pedantic about service in restaurants but these people have *THE WORST service* I have ever had in a restaurant. It took 40 minutes for food to arrive after multiple requests to check on the order. Then it arrived...STONE COLD. I sent it back and asked that it be re-heated..another 20 minutes, with a half-hearted ""...sorry..."" when it was dropped on my table. Then 10 minutes to return the check w/card to sign.  The people at the next table had similar issues. Never again."
1,"My ""Cuban"" test is the appetizers. If you can't get these right, you don't deserve to have your main dishes tried. Delivery was super quick and the guy was very nice. Prices are cheap, so no complaints there. Here's what I had: Ham croqueta: Tasty, no complaints. Papa rellena: Didn't really care for it. Something about the taste that wasn't right, and I personally don't believe olives belong in these, as much as I love them! And raisins, no, definitely not! I'm not one of those Cubans who like raisins in their picadillo. Beef empanada: No, Uh-uh, no way. This sucks. Yuca croqueta: Greasy, oil oozing, yuckiness. They sent a bunch of green sauce on the side, which at first is garlic-y and quite tasty, but then gets spicy REAL quick. It reminds me of the spicy mojo at Peruvian joints. The sauce was too spicy (and I love spicy), it took away from the food because it lingered on your tongue. A little variety would have been nice for this ""sampler"". This place falls flat and not worth another visit by me. Another failed attempt at finding good and affordable Cuban food in Manhattan!"
0,"Awesome. Darn you guys, I can't fit into my holiday dress now..."
0,"Went to Applewood last weekend and It was pretty good.  Scallops, pork and dessert were all good.  My main complaint is that it reflects the stuffiness of Park Slope and doesn't really stand out in a crowd of ""Farm2table"" restaurants that've invaded the country.  I will go back though."
0,picklicious good!  The fried pickles were worth the trip to Astoria.  Many people may not know this but there is an art to fried pickles.  Sweet Afton has figured out the perfect combo of batter to pickle ratio using a perfectly tart pickle - add in a spicy mayo dipping sauce..yummy.  Im a bit of a wuss when it comes to cocktails.  They have a dirty pickle martini which was like pickle infused vodka - I think I would have enjoyed it more mixed with tonic only cause as I said i'm a bit of a wuss and it was too strong for me.  The bar tender was super friendly as was the wait staff.  They were crazy busy and were still all smiles.
0,good food. fun time
1,"Great wraps, very interesting options.  The chocolate and basil milkshake actually works.  Very tasty."
1,"Really cute and quaint place. I was a bit disappointed that they don't do pancakes on the weekends. I had the pumpkin waffles instead, which are pretty tasty - they took me by surprise though as they were more savoury than I thought they would be. Love the apple butter here. Hubby had an egg sandwich, which looked really good. The side of fries were great - really really moreish! I liked this place - it's great for a leisurely brunch or lunch. There were pretty long queues on the weekend, though."
0,"YUM!!  Love this place anytime of day or night.  White Grape Martini, Cobb Salad, Fried Chicken are my favorotie and are always great.  Staff is always so friendly and helpful.   Can't wait for spring so I can sit outside!!!"
0,Just amazing
1,Good drinks nice ambiance. Chill. Would come back for a bite and drink
0,"The best place to meet someone for a drink. I suggest snagging a seat at the bar and flirt with the staff over martini's and oysters. I always meet my dates there before heading out into the night. The best pub crawl I have ever been on started at Balthazar, then moseyed to Raoul's and ended with a bottle of Rose at Bar Pitti."
1,"An unintimidating restaurant with unbelievable everything, this ""tavern"" had a warm and inviting feel. I had the rabbit. (Sorry to those of you freaking out about my eating Thumper.) The rabbit was amaaaazing. It was so soft and juicy. It wasn't tough at all, and I could just picture a fat, fluffy bunny who did nothing but sit there and eat carrot after carrot. I'm sorry, Thumper. For dessert, I had the apricot tart, and it was reeeally awesome. It was beautifully presented and tasted even more wonderful. My tummy says thankee to Thumper & Co."
1,"My wife and I have eaten brunch here on several occasions -- including in their great backyard. The food has always been exceptional, the service is great and the prices are totally reasonable. It's just a short walk from Buttermilk Channel, but never quite as busy. Definitely try the chilaquiles and the huevos rancheros (made with a homemade tortilla). The cocktails are great, too."
0,"when in the neighborhood, we go here for sure, nice atmosphere trendy cool eclectic artsy. the food is decent to great, flavors are satisfying. to get- the hummus platter and the lamb. Don't get the Lite stuff- actually any restaurant beware of this- cook it at home, go for the specials so you will taste their specialties. Turkish coffee to end the meal was de-lish and fun to have."
1,"Quite good. It's no Totto Ramen, but the wait is shorter (if the wait is not shorter, then f**k it, go put your name down at Totto instead). The ramen is a bit trendier, less traditional, but still quite good. They always have at least one vegetarian option. Worth checking out."
0,"I haven't had popovers since I left the UWS 15 years ago!! Great service and excellent food. This is the area's best option right now, and one of the best new restaurants to open."
1,"Had the turkey meatballs with pesto sauce in the Everything Under the Kitchen sink; came with a bunch of mixed vegetables that were excellent; the meal was substantial and a great price for $11; the only downside was that the dish was soaked in olive oil; don't get me wrong, I enjoy olive oil and it has excellent health benefits; however, I felt they over did it on this order; I'll be back to try the beef meatballs"
0,"I don't know where to start.  My son was playing a gig at DROM in NYC and I needed a restaurant close to this spot.  While checking the internet I came across GG's.  I called and Emily answered.  She was polite, patient and I felt just perfect for my crowd of 23.  She gave me a prefix menu that we agreed upon.  It all sounded very good.  The day of the gig my party was down to 13.  I called Emily and she was as calm   (no problem) she said, just come it'll be fine.  She also helped us find a garage near by.  Once there at 5:00PM Nov. 8, 2014 the deliciousness began.  What I thought was just a prefixed menu with some very good ideas from Emily, turned out to be a medley of delicious dishes one after another.  It was family style a  salad, with white pizza and Mediterranean pizza . Then mushrooms, pasta, hamburgers which were cut up into 4's and we were all able to taste, French fries that everyone agreed never had French fries like this, potatoes with vegetables, beets, and roasted chicken to die for,,,then to top it off ice cream with a brownie.  I don't know what to say ... We weren't sure which dish we liked better.  The staff was wonderful.  The place was crowded and why not the food is the best I've tasted in a long time.  It's Tuesday Nov. 11 and I'm still getting calls telling me the restaurant was fantastic.  And each person had their own personal favorite food,  By the way we're all foodies. We ranged from 24-68 years  of age and everyone was thrilled.   There's no way to express my gratitude to Emily and her fine staff for taking care of us as if we were the only guest in the house  My thanks to the Chef, for his food choices and concepts of how they should taste was excellent. Thank you , Thank you, Thank you,  Mary Broderick and guest!!!"
1,"Yes it was awesome. Food was wonderful. Yes it was tight (5 of us squeezed on a table meant for 2) but after a 2 1/2 hour stream of amazing dishes none of us complained. Highlights were definitely the paneer, scallops and strawberry dessert. We called the day before for a reservation for 4 and wanted to add a 5th, after consulting with the chef they obliged, so thank you! The staff was exceedingly nice and explained everything and we all left completely satisfied."
0,"Visited New York for my daughters birthday and we decided to look online for good BBQ in NY. Mighty Quinns received decent reviews so we tried it out. This food is beyond decent. It is extremely delicious. Our group had the ribs and the brisket-naked style. The ribs were great but the brisket...fall off the bone tender. It literally was the best brisket Ive had. The baked beans and sweet potatoe casserole were equally good as sides. Those pickled veggies went perfectly with the meal, just a little spicy. We took the food home and heated in the microwave the next day and the brisket was just as good!! This will definitely be a visit when I come back to NY. Wish there was one in San Francisco!!"
0,"I was completely delighted by the meal I got there.  I am very rarely in that neighborhood and I just saw it across the street. It looked clean and cozy and inviting and the real deal  The people who work there are kind and responsive and gracious, and the lamb cous-cous was some of the best I have ever ever had.  The piece de resistance for me was the sweet strong mint tea with a hint of rosewater in it  Also the homemade hot spice which is incredibly fresh and which the proprietor is justifiably proud.  I completelty recommend it it on all levels."
0,"Mamoun watch out.  Actually Abaleh's falafel is much different.  You can choose your own ingredients and all the food is clean.  Try a falafel pita with hummus, tabouli, eggplant, red cabbage, olives, lettuce, cucumber, and tzatziki sauce. One of the best places in UES."
0,Delicious food comes out of this little french bistro- and it is little- you are literally on top of your neighbor but there isn't a line out the door for nothing. They have tables outside and you can take your dog. Great french food especially the tower of chicken pot pie in puff pastry.
0,"i enjoyed the fried chicken. The skin is extremely crispy but not greasy. I also enjoyed the panna cotta although I thought it could have used more lychee flavor. The scallops with the buttery carrot sauce was delicious too. Some lowlights: our mussels, which were kind of fishy (seemed frozen or kept for too long). The oxtail wasn't as good as expected, either. Some strips of meat were pretty dry and the whole dish lacked flavor."
0,Lombardi's has amazing pizza! For those who live inside and outside of NYC- this place is a must! The wait time is long for a good reason! The pizza has a crispy thin crust with fresh and delightful toppings. I have been there several times and plan on going back again soon!
1,This place is AMAZING!! My bf took me here for my bday and we had the delicious arepas for appetizer. The mojitos were great! I had the passion fruit and my bf had the hennessy mojito. For the entree I had the churrasco with the cilantro mashed and my bf had the surf and turf. The scallops with the pork belly is to die for! I definitely recommend this place. The day I went was raining so we didnt appreciate the view that much. Next tim I want to go during the day.
0,"Oysters are wonderful, but New England clam chowder has too much stuff- tons of celery, chunks of baked potato. Since fish and shellfish are4 so wonderful here, let them speak for themselves."
1,This place is always super crowded and the restaurant itself is very small but the food is pretty good. There was a special a couple weeks ago so the lobster was 2 for 20! pretty good deal :) The duck wasn't as fresh as I thought it'd be though. If you're into lobster then definitely give this place a try.
1,"Say it ain't so. This used to be my go-to place in the neighborhood. There was many a time that Foursquare reminded me I had checked in here for the 3rd time that week ... on a Thursday. Those days are now gone. $18 for a tuna sandwich and a latte is too much. They recently upped their prices to where it no longer feels like my neighborhood hangout, the place I visit 8 times a week - yes, i've been there more than once in a day. Alas, i'm on the hunt for a new hangout that won't charge me more for a cup of coffee than Starbucks."
1,BEST HALAL BEST PRICE These guys really give you a mountain of excellent tasting middle eastern food. I always feel great after eating this stuff. Warning: The hot sauce can be intense so use sparingly.
1,"Coming from the UK, the idea of a restaurant inside a department store conjures up some nightmarish visions, and more importantly of odours being deep drilled into clothing and other items you'd want to purchase having enjoyed lunch. Not so with Stella 34 though and you can tell this from the second that the elevator (lift) doors open... Light and airy with a very modern feel, we were immediately made to feel at home and welcome by the friendly staff who got us sat down almost immediately, and handed us the simple lunch menu (along with NY Restaurant Week Specials) and then scurried off to help the next group. When the food arrived it was extremely good - the starter of sausage and mozzarella was fried to perfection, and the pizza (albeit a little damp) tasted very good - and more than a little spicy. The wait staff were delightful and full of suggestions and the food was very good at the price point! Wouldn't hesitate to visit again."
0,I love this place!  The staff is super friendly and the food is quick and delicious. Try one of the chicken sandwiches on a semolina roll....and try to sit in the front room.
0,"Holy Greek food Batman! This is the best food truck in the city, hands down. If you haven't tried it, you don't even know. Uncle Gussy hooks it up, and hot damn is it good. The service is fast, the greek friends are too good, and the tzaziki sauce is some of the best ever. Get the lamb, get the salad, get it all before I come in and take it. Try this place, or else."
1,"Updating my review from last time: Had an amazing night at Pates et Traditions. It took the fois gras (very good) and a pasta dish with chicken which was amazing. For dessert, I took a crepe. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. Service was better than last time. Definitely an improvement from my last visit."
0,"Typical Thai restaurant, cheap and quick.  It's scarey walking into the bar area because you never know if it's empty or packed until you get to the dining room.  Even though you are rushed through dinner like cattle going to slaughter, the prices of the food is great.  The drinks add up, but the food is good, fast and cheap.  If it wasn't for the blaring techno music, it'd get more stars."
0,This place is sooooooo frikin good. I had one of these huge slices when I visiting my buddy at NYU. Best NYC pizza. The basil they use is awesome. There was a crowd when we wen
1,"First time trying Dominican food and it was average-above average. I wasn't extremely overwhelmed with how good it was, but I still quite enjoyed my meal. Upon arriving at this place, you'll notice how small it is and you wonder whether your party of 4 or 5 will even fit. But, you will. Some lady sat us down at a small table and handed us their takeout menu.. we each got some stewed meat and most of us enjoyed our food. The beef was a little overcooked as was the cod fish, but the oxtail was very very tender and good. I also highly recommend getting the Mofongo! It was really yummy with the gravy sauce thing that came with it. I believe it's some sort of mashed up plantains with meat. We ate a lot of food and were pretty stuffed, and we barely put a dent in our wallets. This place is very affordable to say the least. The service wasn't the best, but I'm not complaining given that it seems like most people get takeout here."
1,"I love chicken and rice! This place is amazing! The only reason I'm giving it a four is because of the long lines! The key is they actually three carts, take a look at the right side and on the north west side of 52 nd street! As a city kid, I've tried theirs more than a hundred times. I've also tried multiple different chicken and rice plates... The white sauce here is the best... You can imitate the chicken and the rice but you can't get that white sauce anywhere else."
1,Excellent! From the service to the dishes everything was great! I've been here for brunch and dinner a couple of times. Can't wait to go back again.
0,BBq chicken is delightful and the mac and cheese compliments the meal. Service is very friendly and always fairly fast. The atmosphere is MUCH better in the downstairs part. Very comfortable and diner-y.
0,"yum yum yum! Thank you Marlow & Sons! Yet again you have made my day wish you perfect (yes perfect) cappuccino, and deliciously flakey croissant. Too many wonderful things here. Really, too many. I kinda wish I could put my bed here and just live around all the wonderful yummy things."
0,Not a bad little spot to hang out and grab a margarita. The corn is great and the sandwiches are not bad either. The patio area outside is nice to hang out on a spring afternoon.
1,"The food at Mariella is amazing. In a space once occupied by Sweet Wolfs, you are presented with a wonderful menu and often, a list of specials. They did get their liquor license and they serve some wonderful Italian wines. The Eggs Benedict is perfect. For dinner, the pasta is fresh. They also have dishes like short ribs (which are to die for). The space it intimate and the owner has a fantastic personality. Simply a wonderful addition to South Slope. A+"
0,I went for brunch and we almost lost our reservation because my friend was running late (they only hold reservations for 15 minutes). Thankfully she made it just in the nick of time. I had the sigsig (pork bits and pieces) served on a cast iron skillet with a freshly scrambled egg. It was delicious. Service was also great.
0,Love this place.  Love the pork buns and the bossam.  Make sure you order extra oysters and go extra on the kimchee puree.  Cant go wrong with any david chang restaurant.
1,great selection of gf pizza and risotto.  thin crust is very good.  need to improve new thick crust pizza (not good).   interesting gf deserts.  Loved the gf tres leches cake! Every time I come here the place is really crowded: any plans to expand?
0,"We celebrated my wife's leap day birthday here and had an absolutely wonderful experience. It was a rainy Wednesday night and we were the only customers for a while, which is perhaps why we received more attention than we would have on a crowded night; but in any case, the waitress and the chef were very friendly, attentive, conversational, and made lots of good recommendations. They took special care to explain the veggie options to our daughter, who's a vegetarian, and even offered to make up special dishes with the meat taken out. When we ordered dessert, it came out with a candle and a birthday message for my wife written in chocolate syrup on the rim of the plate. In short, it was really thoughtful, considerate, exceptional service. The food was wonderful. We had a beet dish, lobster pasta, haddock, and duck (the house specialty), and all of it was exquisite. In short, I highly recommend the place. I can see how perhaps you might not have as great an experience if you come during a very busy time -- the room is quite small, and the staff might perhaps be more stressed out -- so you might want to call ahead and make a reservation for a slower time. As we experienced it, the food and the service were nothing short of outstanding."
1,Went here for brunch with a friend and was very pleased! Great shrimp rancheros and she ordered steak and eggs... lots of tasty food and very good portions. Had a cocktail which was included with brunch ($15-$17) Staff was very accommodating and friendly - will be back for sure!
1,I have a weird hatred towards egg whites and after much convincing I tried the deviled eggs here - without leaving the egg whites and was so happy I did!  My mouth still waters just thinking about it. I was surprisingly disappointed by the burgers but this is largely due to the fact that I hate bleu cheese.
0,"The food was great..but the service was disgusting...the waitress with the blonde hair short in stature acted like she was doing us a favor by serving us. My friend's grits were cold and she huffed and puffed before she changed them......her attitude was deplorable.....We did not know about the cash only policy..so when when we inquired, she remarked very snidely that there is an atm next door-use it!.......My friend wrote her a nice note on the receipt stating that she should be nicer and instead of apologizing she started to talk about her hamstring problems...needless to say my friend took her tip back from the waitress and then the disgust vile creature said --""That's ok--we dont need patronage from customers like you""--We were all African American-----Clinton St. Baking Company will be hearing from my lawyers soon"
0,"Really enjoyed th baked goods. A large variety, moist and flavorful.  We usually over order and then freeze what we don't eat right away"
0,"After reading the reviews on Yelp, I finally decided to go there. I have to say that the trip was worth it. I really like that place. The food was not orgasmic, but it wasn't bad. I had a lot of fun there, so me and my friends want to go there together next time. The atmosphere there is just amazing, great place to come and relax with friends. Gramercy Tavern also is very affordable. I really like the ratio of price over quality there. I hope I could give them 5 stars, but may be next time when I go there with friends. 4 stars for now."
1,"Great Cuban restaurant around West 4, this place has great food, great service, wonderful mojitos (coconut mojitos are awesome) and great live music. Make a reservation because this place is small and gets packed. Its worth the money and the time. Great experience here."
1,Excellent place with delicious healthy food at a really reasonable price for lunch or dinner. Become one of my staples
1,"Their regular and beef soondubu is really good! However, their seafood tofu soup was a bit off. Tasted like it wasn't seasoned right. Also, I wouldn't order their tofu/kimchi dish as the tofu comes out burnt. I would definitely return for their regular tofu soup or for their two person meat thing (bossam) but I am not so sure about the other dishes. Also note- like any other place with decent food, this place can be quite a wait during dinner. Either go early like at 5PM or make reservations."
0,"I went to NYC and asked my tour guide about the best halal food and he said its by far this cart. I was NOT disappointed. I had a couple other cart's food and this is MUCH better. Too bad that I didnt get a chance to go back. P.S. For all those crying about the hot sauce, that is the correct amount of spice that it should be. Not as spicy as Pakistani food but for Arab food, this is really good."
0,"Everything was absolutely amazing here. The wine, the tapas. The Froie Gras (spelling?) was to die, the cheese and the octopus were sooo good. It also has a great atmosphere and in a good location. Yum"
1,Great atmosphere!
0,"They make my absolute favorite Vietnamese sandwiches.  I always get the original BBQ pork sandwich. The flavor is so delicious- sweet mixed with salty, and the pickled vegetables add another dimension of flavor.  They are generous with the meat and fixings but the price is so reasonable.  Many other places are mostly bread with very little filling but they cost more too.  I've been eating Banh Mi Saigon sandwiches since I was a kid, so around 30 years, give or take.  I have always found their sandwiches consistently delicious.  This is the place I always recommend to friends and people who want a great Vietnamese sandwich.  Try it!  You will not regret it!"
1,"I'M IN LOVE!  If ever there was a place that embodied the perfect little restaurant, I would argue this is it!  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming while still remaining special.  The service is refreshingly professional without being pretentious.  The cocktails are remarkable because they are truly unique, well-crafted with fresh ingredients and a sense of pride on behalf of the bartender.  The food...well the food is simply amazing and unexpected from such an unassuming little enclave. YOU MUST HAVE THE MAC & CHEESE!  I understand that everyone and their mother will say their mac & cheese is the best but I assure you it is not...Jack's is the best!  I have tried their burger, steak, pork chops and a veggie risotto special.  All of these were divine!  The menu at first sight seems simple but another look and you'll find that your meal will be just a touch unique.  I happen to like places where I recognize the dishes and their ingredients but also know my palate will experience a new twist on the tried-and-true. The atmosphere is storybook. Brick walls, big windows, candle light all hidden away in a charming little corner of Brooklyn Heights. Might I also add that the owner's love for his place & his craft is incredibly apparent.  He was friendly with us and even bussed our table since he knew they were busy that night. You simple can't beat that kind of customer attention and appreciation."
1,"The halal guys never fail me. It satisfies my every late night craving in every way. The portion size is huge with the chicken being perfectly cooked and the rice always fluffy. Definitely different from the crap that's available near me. That being said, it's always worth a trip here as the taste and price are always on point. Easy on the hot sauce unless you really like the kick because it is hoooot but extremely delicious."
1,"The restaurant does not serve the most traditional Thai cuisine but there are many things that make this place endearing.  First, while the place is pretty small and can be a cramped (but what else is new in NY restaurants), the decor is modern and clean.  Second, as everyone agrees, the Thai iced tea with the frozen Thai iced tea cubes is quite delectable and the whole presentation of the tea with its milk , syrup and the the cubes is a real eye candy.  The idea of frozen ice tea cubes is just genius- they preserve the flavor of the tea throughout the meal and are also pretty to look at. Our entrees- green curry and the PCU noodles were tasty and also surprisingly large, considering this place at first glance seem like another one of those frou frou restaurants that serves tiny portions of food.  The fries with the chili mayo sauce were also very good,,with the mayo sauce not being too spicy and with just the right flavor of tanginess.  The servers were polite and attentive but were not overbearing.  On top of all these great qualities, the bill came out to be quite reasonable.  We left the restaurant pretty happy.  It satisfies the girl's liking for ambience, presentation, and taste and also makes the ever so practical guy happy with its value and quality."
1,Gnocchi for days!! That's my favorite dish !! I've been here more than once  and they never fail . Definitely stopping by again and again. Love the authentic homemade  mozzarella !!!
1,"All I have to say is Meatball Parmigana sandwich.  The absolute most delicious item on the menu for me.  I don't even look at the menu when I walk in anymore.  Sometimes I do... and then I throw it down saying, ""Who am I kidding??  I'll just be disappointed if I don't get the Meatball Parm sandwich"".  The combination of a great meatball with awesome sauce and excellent bread from Grandaisy bakery makes it a superb sandwich overall.  I didn't know that I would love a Meatball Parm sandwich this much... but I do!  Oh.. and the BLT sandwich is pretty good too.   :) p.s. the wait can be long because people know how awesome it is."
0,"Here are.... Very very delicious BBQ and my favorite tofu soup Best thing is I can choose kinds of tofu....kimchi , dumpling, pork, seafood, and so on... This place is awesome!!!!!! Lovely service, moderate sound control & deco. Relatively inexpensive compared with steak house,too , not bad.... I'm definitely going back there again!!!!!"
1,The line is long with particularly with tourists coming off the brooklyn bridge.  So for sitting down there is a bit of a line.  Takeout is much speedier.
1,"Definitely one of the better Thai places in the city (got a 24 on Zagat for food taste, and I would give it around that score (perhaps a 23ish). I got take-out, but the place is oddly cute inside. Rustic wooden tables with slightly tacky, brightly colored chairs. Definitely not a romantic date place, but good for a casual date. Small restaurant. There's a small area in the middle where you can see a lady cooking (but the main kitchen is in the back). Definitely a solid 4 of 5. FOOD - Ratchaburi crab & pork dry noodles ($10 lunch/$12 dinner) - handmade egg noodles, roasted pork, lump crab meat, yu choy, scallion; great light dish; ramen-like noodles with a lot of yu choy (very similar to bok choy but greener with more flavor); the sauce is slightly sweet and light - almost vinegary - it's a clear, watery liquid; the crab meat is great (not the imitation kind) but could have used a bit more of it; the roasted pork was copious (thinly sliced with that red border around it). Portion is pretty small so it probably can't be a meal in and of itself. However, flavors were great, and it has a great fresh taste to it. Solid 4 of 5 stars. Pad kee moa with calamari ($9 lunch/$11 dinner) - never had pad kee moa with squid before, but this is delicious; the noodles were great (but a little too mushy); sauce was flavorful and there was a lot of it; the vegetables were of good quality and there was a lot of it (particularly like the thick tomato wedges); however, this was not as spicy as most pad kee moas. In fact, I thought it missed the chili altogether (maybe they did). The flavor was amazing, but it could have used a little kick. Regardless, was one of the better pad kee moas I've had. If it had the spicy kick, it would definitely be a solid 4 or 4.5; as I ate it, it's about a low 4. Good-sized portion."
0,Once a month my younger cousin and I have a Dinner PlayDate. The ambiance was very nice. The food was delcious. The staff was very hospitable. I would reccomend this location for autentic Indian cuisine.
1,"if I could marry a restaurant, I would marry this one. It's dreamy, nuanced, attentive, authentic, satisfying and comforting. I like going alone for some quiet time, reflection and nutrition. I love you Samurai Mama, (get's down on one knee) will you marry me?"
1,Best Burger in NYC... Look no further
0,Can't beat the $15 beer and burger on Sundays.  And what a good burger it was too.  They give you an unbelievable about of fries but they are perhaps a little overly salted.  The table we were sat at was pretty much too small to actually be able to look at the menu but that didn't matter as we both knew we wanted the burger.  Service was good and very friendly.  Will definitely go back.
1,"Every time I've gone, my friends and I were the only ones there. It's kinda creepy if you think about it but nice because you don't have to wait ridiculous lines when you're hungry. Appetizers: ugly dumplings (yum) and brie and poached pear bruschetta (different. don't know how I feel about it). Main entrees: fire grilled tender chicken with a korean fusion marinade served with salad and sweet potato rice (I absolutely loveeeee this dish. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. and I think this is the only plate that actually had a lot of food on the plate). spicy amatriciana- portion was on the smaller end but it was tasty :) pulled pork sandwich- i don't eat pork but my friend enjoyed it. pork belly- they give you two pieces. They're thick but I think my friend was still hungry  at the end of the meal. Prices weren't crazy. I'd definitely recommend to anyone."
1,"Beef sesame sandwich is so good, I could eat it every day!  The chive & pork dumpling is always a great pick.  And yes, you can eat like a king for $5.  It can get crowded at certain times but they're very efficient."
0,"The place was pretty, but my husband did not like the food being that his father is part colombian we were hoping to see more colombian plates , atleast more tradional plates, all we saw was american latin plates, the drinks were generous , the wait staff was alittle slow , The kids enjoyed some of the food . but it was alittle too loud ,and it was a lively crowd there , so it seemed like happy place to be"
0,"One of the best places in the hood , I Love the food here"
1,"I stopped by on a Sunday at 4PM thinking it wouldn't be too crowded. I was wrong, but I still managed to get a single seat at the counter.  I ordered the Miso Ramen with wavy noodles and it was solid.  I think the menu said they put peanut butter in it, and there was something more rich about the broth.  Just a tiny layer of something different. I like that it had pretty big pieces of pork as well as 5 different toppings. It included corn, wood ears (I think), onion, menma, and bean sprouts. I imagine it's pretty difficult to get a table for any reasonable sized group."
0,Excellent food and the highest of service standards without the stuffy formal atmosphere of other high end restaurants. Very relaxed setting. Would recommend anytime for special occasion lunches. Loved the baby beets with spiced nuts and the mushroom lasagna. Will definitely try to come back soon.
1,"First time I dined here, I had the most delicious french toast I have ever put in my mouth.  Second time I had the fried chicken and waffle- yum but come on guys- an ego waffle????  Chicken was so good but that ego just isn't doing it for me, invest in a waffle maker and make it happen.  Open face egg McRuffin-  yuuuuuuuuum!  And it's served with tots which are a fav of mine.   Honestly the only drawback to this place is the overly- enthusiastic waitress/ hostess.  She's a sweetie but a little loud and way over the top.   Bottom line is it's a sure bet for yum."
1,"The decor is very cute, and the food was good. But the 1 star is based on the following: My friend and I came here for dinner, when we received our check we were pleased with the price of the bill and didn't ask questions. Gave our credit card, signed the receipt, put on our coats and even made an additional reservation for next week and left the restaurant. When we were more then halfway down the block we hear someone repeatedly screaming 'excuse me' and running toward us. It was our WAITRESS, asking us for our credit card back because she made a mistake on the bill!  We were mortified.  When we spoke to the manager she did nothing but apologize and tell us to make sure we check our statement bc she voided the previous charge. This experience was unprofessional and unnecessary. She looked at the bill many times, and her mistake shouldn't have turned out to be ours. Definitely NEVER returning. This wouldn't have happened at KEFI!"
1,Cheap.  Chicken so good.  Cheap.  Cheap.  Cheap.  Love.  Love.  Love. Wish they didn't close so early (9:00pm).   Can't wait to try the ribs!
1,"This place is a neighborhood staple serving up some of the best food out of a cart (now brand new good truck). The line is sometimes long but they hand out free falafel while you wait. Fun to watch all the guys cooking and chatting with regulars. It's fast, convenient and always hits the spot. Everything on menu is great but I love their chicken and rice combo with extra got sauce. It's hard to beat the price and quality anywhere else. So happy they are there!"
0,"They have a great quality with the best price!! We had a large size of square pizza ($19) and rucola was so fresh. I love their mellow ambience with harmonious music as well. I'll definitely visit again. The bathroom was also spacious and clean. It's often said that you should check the bathroom when you try restaurants for the first time in order to see if they are paying close attention to detail. I've been living in the city for a year and sometimes I get disappointed by bathrooms in NYC's restaurants after I enjoy meals and decors, but I can't beat this restaurant after I got satisfied with their cleanness."
0,"i always think the pizza from this restaurant tastes just amazing as their fame. i'd waited almost one hour to get the pizza, and they didn't disappoint me even though i waited really long. everything was perfect ; the proportion of the sauce and mozzarella, nice crust dough and fresh taste. i really liked the way they baked the pizza from brick oven, it reminded me of the pizza that i had in Italy.   Except the size of the toppings, everything is just great. Anyone who loves pizza and especially who wants to have amazing pizza they'll love this place."
0,"The food and service were absolutely incredible... My wife and I had the cod fish fritters, chicharron de pollo, plantains, ropa vieja and arroz con pollo. Everything was flavorful and delicious! The entree portions were very large. The prices were reasonable. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Cuban food. In fact, I'll be returning with a larger group on Friday! The only drawback is that they don't have a full bar (beer and wine only). Fortunately, the sangria was delicious as well."
0,"Really really different taste of Thai.  Delicious and tasty.   Ratchaburi pork is my fave.  They come out with different specials and they are all must-try's.   Whenever we are in the city, Pure Thai is always our destination for a special lunch and dinner.  Small place but waiting is reasonable.  Groups of 5 or 6 is the max.  But we always come back.  Great good!"
1,"Great Place! Quesedillas are perfect, soft taco shells are the real deal."
1,We order Cioppino. We looking forward for the lobster. But very dissappointly. The lobster was not fresh... taste funy!. We did also order fried oyser. That was good. But little pricey for the amount of food.
1,"First off: Thank you YELP for my free glass of wine with my check in! The fresh burrata crostini was exactly that: fresh bouncy bread, crispy edges covered in cold burrata and doused with a rustic cooked pepper mixture and arugula. The chicken, the chicken, the chicken! Get the chicken! I usually read the menu and skip over the usual chicken dish, but our super rad waiter Drew said, ""the chicken is my faves."" Did he just say faves? He did. ""I'll take the chicken."" OH, and it was my faves. It was a huge portion of juicy, tender, brined chicken with a crispy crusty skin, served with diable sauce on the side (more sodium if you will). The sautéed kale was deliciously salty and juicy-uicy. Dessert was no let down either... the Parisian apple tart was a delicate pastry with tangy sliced apples. It's acidity was perfectly balanced with their creme fraiche. For those of you whose sweet tooth doesn't crave the sugary desserts, this is right up your alley. My dining partner got the ice cream profiteroles with their homemade chocolate fudge sauce. I didn't even get a bite!!!! And to all of you complainers, there were salt and pepper shakers at our table, the server made himself readily available and it wasn't that loud inside."
1,"I was curious to see what their take on Colombian food was, which is generally known to be at its best in Astoria. Well I was quite impressed. I started with some chips and Guac (fine not colombian, but toss it in) and enjoyed it. Ordered myself some Arozz con Pollo which came with yellow rice mixed with diced grilled chicken, plantains, black beans, and other veggies. Overall it tasted very authentic, and was prepared nicely. My friends raved about the mixed margaritas (didn't personally try it though). Service was I thought a little slow, but thats not always bad if you want to keep the conversations going and the drinks flowing. I liked the decour, with a few sprinklings of Colombia all over the restaurnt, including on the menu. A little odd to just have 2 unisex bathrooms (seemed to move slow) but overall a solid Colombian establishment in an area of the city not really known for Colombian food."
0,"Food: 5/5 Everything I've tried tastes great. The goat cheese tart, mussels, and filet mignon are highly recommended. Venue: 3/5 The place feels a little cramped and the ambient noise is a little too loud for my liking -- I always have trouble hearing my date when we're talking. Otherwise, it's cozy and the darkness enhances the atmosphere. Price: 5/5 The dishes are expensive but for the quality/taste it's well worth it. Service: 5/5 The ladies are always lovely. Verdict: It's definitely one of the best French Restaurants in NYC."
0,"This hole in the wall has been around forever and is not to be missed.  The aroma of the fries wafts out on the sidewalk and entices diners to come in for good reason.  The fries are hot, crusty and salty in ample portion.  Even though the place is too small to get comfortable, its more than OK because the fries are so good it doesn't take long to devour them! The only challenge is that sometimes the credit card machine isn't working and the E. Village crowd is full of folks who no longer use cash and have to dash to the nearest ATM.   HINT:  Be adventurous and try a new sauce each time.  You will be rewarded!"
0,"I am from Tokyo and Ippudo is one of my TOP 3 ramen places in NYC. (others are Zen 6 and Totto Ramen) The recipe for the broth is a bit different from Ippudo in Japan but it certainly keeps a traditional flavor. Unlike, Ippudo in Japan, the locations in Manhattan offer a very tasty selection of appetizers. Goma kyuri and edamame are some light ones to snack with a beer while you wait for the ramen. If you feel like some heavier starters, Samurai shortrib and Hirata chiken wings are super tasty. Don't forget to try the Hirata Buns (they are a must). *Both Manhattan locations are very popular so rsvp is recommended."
0,"I love how chill back this place is..Food was very good and service was a BIG plus...All and all very cool ,yummy place to visit."
0,"I found this amazing gem of a restaurant while waiting for a friend to meet me at another place. I was early for my friend, so popped into Cielo for a drink. I was awed by the atmosphere, friendliness and superior food! This place is wonderful. The owner/manager Isabella is so warm and welcoming that I ended up having my friend meet me at Cielo instead of our original destination. Now I'm a confirmed fan and will be a die-hard regular. Don't miss this place!"
0,Had the fish taco and bacon wrapped jalapeno hot dog. Best things I have ever eaten. Definitely coming back
0,"Very qualified and well dressed staff takes you on a culinary adventure in beautiful original setting. You can choose the wine pairing or discover new tastes and pairings with other drinks like sake,cocktails, beer,... We especially enjoyed the cheese based ice cream."
0,This is a fun tasty restaurant. Every dish I had was great. I will return
0,This is great japanese food. For a fun meal sit at the bar and you will see the chefs like ninjas jumping from one end to the other and handing you your food with a long spatula. Everything grilled to perfection but keep in mind portions are very small so you keep ordering then you end up surprised with a large bill.
1,"We live in LA now. Just went to my husband's holiday dinner for work and the guy sitting across from me (another spouse) and I started talking about NYC he said he just came back from NYC and asked if I've ever been to Adrienne's? Um, that's how good this place is. This guy is Italian and pizza is his blood, he said it was probably the best pizza he's had in the US (Italy don't count) and can still taste it. I concur 100%, this place is fantastic. We used to get takeout from here all the time because we lived around the corner on Broad. When the weather is nice, it's GREAT to sit outside and enjoy the tables and communal seating on Stone St. My fave pizzas here are the regular cheese with jalapeño and the fresh buffalo mozzarella - seriously delicious."
1,The best pizza and Spumoni ice cream know to MAN! Such a Brooklyn Staple and with good reason! Love this place!
1,"I don't think anyone understands my love for the Halal guys. They offer the best food there ever is on this planet. I don't always stop by Manhattan but when I do I HAVE to get the chicken over rice from here. It's a great portion for only $6. what more can someone ask for. They also have the hottest hot sauce I ever had and I love it. I prefer both the white sauce(I'm not sure what it is) and the hot sauce together over my food. I have yet to try the other dishes from them but I have all the time in the world for that. I suggest everyone to try them at least once, I know the line is long but it is worth the wait, trust me. ps. there are other food carts around the area that impersonates them, so don't fall for it. Make sure you're going to the right one."
1,"I'm not going to tell you never come here. Vanessa's is a good place. It's not a great place. But it has its shining points. First of all, when I think of Vanessa's, I think of ""variety"". They have a long list of items that they offer which is a joy. For one, their sandwiches are awesome. I had a Peking Duck Sandwhich that was stuffed with the famous (roasted?) duck, a generous slaw of veggies, fresh scallions (green onions), all lovingly held together with gobs of tasty hoisin sauce. The one flaw (and albeit, a major one) was that the sesame pancake bread didn't have enough/any salt. It was so horribly bland! Luckily, the hoisin sauce had more than enough sodium for the sandwich, but salt (actually, lack there of) is Vanessa's achilles heel. They obviously don't salt their dough, which totally detracts from their dumplings. They're bland! Of their fairly long list of dumplings, I think the only ones worth trying are their steamed chicken dumplings and shrimp dumplings. The fried pork dumplings? Bland. Veggie dumplings? Eh. Steamed pork dumplings? Omg, did you really ask?! You want pork dumplings? Don't be lazy. Walk over to Prosperity Dumpling. (Btw, Prosperity expanded their menu, but it's mostly gross. Stick to the sesame pancake and pork dumplings) You want anything but pork dumplings?  Give Vanessa's a try. And if you don't believe me about the salt, just try their dumpling sampler and know that you were warned! :) Happy eating!"
1,"I came here for dinner with my partner for dinner. We split an order of the vegetable spring rolls, and I got an order of the Nakorn-Patom Duck Noodles Soup for my entree. I was expecting the spring rolls to be fresh (which was kind of an assumption on my part since the menu didn't say either way) but they were fried. They weren't bad, just not what I was expecting. They were also on the tiny side. The soup was good, but the duck meat was a little too fatty for my taste. I'd definitely try them again!"
1,"Had brunch here with my buddies on a busy perfect Sunday afternoon. My friend and I waited for our other friend to arrive for like an hour.  I know, what a flake, but no worries, cause the people were great!  We were totally shooting the poop with the the staff while chillin at the counter. Not to mention there was the occasional hook up with cookies, sausages, orange wedges, coffee, hand sanitizer.... how freaking awesome is that! What we had was some simple and good ol' breakfast food, which can never go wrong. :D -eggs florentine -bacon omelet -eggs benedict ""Tom, I shall be back!"""
1,"I work in Midtown West and it is very difficult to find a good, inexpensive lunch in this area that doesn't come off a street vendor. I stumbled upon this place by accident one time when I was going somewhere else and saw people lined up around the corner for this place. I was immediately intrigued. The wait is well worth it as you can get a large soup and a sandwich for around $6.50. A deal that cannot be beat, especially in the area it's in. The sandwiches are all pre-made and are certainly not the staple of this little place. I've been here quite a few times and have not had a soup that wasn't delicious. Don't let the long line or extensive soup selection intimidate you they are extremely fast and efficient and are always willing to offer up free samples if you want to try a couple soups before deciding. I felt five stars was necessary here because it's just simply the best deal in the area by a landslide."
0,"Great backyard- great for groups. Good pizza. Summertime place. Get there early eve to get a spot outside- awesome for groups smokers beer snobs, hipsters and neighborhoodies."
0,"Simply said, ""THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK."" Wow. The decor is incredibly beautiful. There are always fresh flowers. The bar is beautiful. The ceilings are high and the colors put you at rest. The service....it is the best in New York City. The food is fantastic. The drinks are terrific. You can dine in the dining room or in the bar area. They have two different menus...depending of where you sit. I like the bar area for lunch and the dining room for dinner."
0,"Izakayai that can't be beat! The food is awesome! I tried just about everything I could get my hands on, but the soft shell crab too first place with the pork belly skewer as a close second. I sat at the main counter, where the service was prompt ans the Saki kept flowing. I recommend getting there when it place opens, because the line gets long quick. This is a great date night venue."
1,"I tried: all you can eat hot pot Pros: - Excellent service through two different visits - Lots of variety in food, broths (6+), and dipping sauces (12+) - Each person gets their own hot pot, so for people that don't like sharing or getting stuff mixed in one big pot, this is perfect (and unique in my experience) Cons: - As most AYCE places in NYC go, a little on the expensive side - Long wait if you don't make a reservation In my personal list of best food types, hot pot on the whole is not one of them. Meaning, I can't imagine ever enjoy hot pot as much as I enjoy a good steak or burger. That being said, this was one of the best hot pots I've had (which is also not that many), but what really topped everything off for me was the service and variety of food offered. We had a decent number of Chinese speakers in my group which obviously helps, but the waiters joked with us, offered to take a group picture with us (we had a group of 10), and were overall very personable. There are just over a dozen different dipping sauces to choose from, as well as 6-8 broths for your hotpot and almost every imaginable meat or (Chinese) vegetable to order. To be honest, to fully enjoy the food you better know how to make a good dip. Chinese hot pot generally has a slightly more plain broth and no seasoning on the meats/veggies, but after cooking the food you dip it in a sauce in it. With this in mind, I would recommend re-making your sauce if you don't like what you end up with at first. While you get some flavor from the broth and meat itself, the goodness really comes from mixing the appropriate sauces at the sauce station. How much you enjoy your meal really depends on this, and it's fun to mix the sauces or try things that your friends made. TL;DR. 5 stars for great hot pot, great service, and great variety in the food. Even though it's AYCE, you don't have to eat too much of one thing to be full because of the variety."
1,My aunt and uncle were in town for a function - right around my birthday. We took them to this lovely establishment. The tartes were amazing - so flavorful. They had a nice selection of wines and wonderful coffee. The best was the dessert tarte - a light cheese with strawberries and chocolate sauce to drizzle. The ambiance was charming and we lucked out with a table for four right around the lunch hour. We are definitely going to La Tarte Flambee again - soon!
0,"My girl and I just went here last weekend based on some of these reviews for our anniversary as well. Not being a very big ""planner"" I called day of for a reservation and was told they didn't do them for less than 5 people day of, and that the dining room was booked for the night, but to ask if anyone didn't show when you arrived. We got there and they said it would be about the same wait for both rooms. I let her know that it was our anniversary so we would wait for the nicer dining room with the three course meal. B/f I was done with my glass of wine, they came over to seat us....This is a place that gets all the details right...like placing out wine glasses on a tray to bring to the table...when we sat our excellent waiter came over with a bottle of sparkling wine from Spain to congratulate us on our anniversary. When it came time to order I asked his advice on three wines i liked, and having seen the price range i was looking at, and the kind of wine, he offered another suggestion that was excellent (Can Blau 05). Then we had a spoonful of fish tartar and other little veggies, apparently to awaken our palate. My girl had the crab ravioli and I got the lobster appetizer--Get the crab, the sauce was crazy good. Then for the meal I always ask my waiter and got the pork bellies and savored every bite, tender with a sauce that made me want to lick the bowl.--Side note--we know an ave amount about food and didn't know what a couple of the things on the menu were and the staff were very courteous and warm in their explanations so I didn't feel like an idiot asking what char was.---then we opted for a cheese plate and ordered three that sounded good, and she then brought over 4 kinds so we could try another she liked on the house, and ended with her getting the chocolate mouse, and I got the cheese cake---Go with the chocolate---then i finished with a cappuccino. At the end our waiter, Mathew, even brought the label to our wine in a card along with two coffee cakes to enjoy the next morning...The entire meal was excellent, the staff amazing, friendly, and very knowledgeable. the food, great--for a four course meal, a bottle of wine, and a couple of glasses to start,  with tip it was $300 and I would gladly spend that much again.......next year (the tavern seating is cheaper)"
0,"I live next door, so I see it all.  Hearth is as close to a grand-slam as you could reasonably expect to find: amazingly human/friendly/helpful service, fantastic wines (try their wine bar three doors down, Terroir), and homemade Italian food that makes your toes curl.  Chef Marco's wintery comfort food, ribolita, is sometimes all I crave for weeks on end: a hearty bread-and-bean soup/stew/thing that's beyond amazing. One criticism, to prove I'm not being paid to glow: the busboys get *really* bitchy sometimes, and I've noticed the serving staff fighting with them numerous times just to get someone's table (once it was mine) cleared off quickly enough.  Dirty plates become unappetizing quickly, so smarten up, you awesome people!"
0,so good. omg!
1,"Came here with a group of 12, and we only had to wait an hour on a Sunday night; that's really not bad at all!  We cannot chronicle everything the group had, although they were mostly positive reviews. We had the chicken and red velvet waffles and the blackened salmon along with small helpings of a shared Mac n Cheese.  The blackened salmon was very good, very moist and well seasoned without it being too spicy.  The red velvet waffles and fried chicken looked amazing, and tasted pretty good.  Don't expect too much of a red velvet flavor as typical in most cupcakes.  Red velvet really only indicates the color and nothing about the batter itself.  Typical waffle batter with red color is all it really is.  The chicken, as best as I can remember, was good. Most interesting tidbit about this restaurant is the polarity of the customers to the ambience.  Restaurant sells southern comfort food, but looks like a high end trendy restaurant on Park Ave.  The place is cleanly decorated and the staff is dressed very chic.  There was even a violin player the night we were there.  It almost felt like the place should be serving small pretentious meals on little platters.   However, customers are very casual and laid back, there is no dress code but there is no discomfort shown by either side.  Very interesting spot and very good food."
1,"So I found this place via yelp for my birthday girls brunch. I strongly recommend reservations. I had a group of 11 and were able to fit at the biggest table under the skylight. I enjoyed the table arrangement. High table, high chairs. Soft music playing so that you are able to have conversations with everyone at the table and I loved the sky light above with the lamp arrangement that looks like white balloons to me :) Now my focus was to come and have boozy brunch. BUT in order to partake - you need everyone in your party to commit to same brunch package . $29 gives you a half liter (approx 3 glasses) or $39 is for bottomless.  The rest of the package depends on the amount of people in your group. YMy group had choice of 3 pizzas, 3 brunch plates and 2 sides. If you want anything extra it is ""a la carte"". We chose things based on being fair to meat eaters, someone who didn't eat seafood, people who didn't eat pork and vegetarians.  Since this is a family style type of dining for Boozey brunch- it could have been complicated but ended up being perfect since we had to order 1-2 a la carte items. I had a great experience. Service was friendly and food and drink came at a good pace. I will say that the top 3 fave dishes were the French Toast ( OMG) , the mushroom pizza and the steak/egg hash. The crab scramble was ok- not as memorable as I would have thought. If I still meat, then I would have tried my old fave eggs Benedict here . Anyway I was very happy with my choice for this years bday. I wanted something brunchy, mellow, low key ( meaning comfortable and not a party brunch atmosphere) , with good food and good service and I got it ;) cheers Ps- I would like to return and tried the Doit yourself prosecco bar $20 for the DIY and the bottle is extra . Ill be back"
1,"Good food, huge portion, and popular(hence crowded)"
0,The best in WV. I been getting Sabich and Falafel sandwiches here for over three years and the quality only increased with time!
0,love it! amazing pizza
0,Love the food but hate the new prices. 5 years ago you could walk in and feed a family of 4 for under $35.00 with tip. Now the same meals will cost about $55.00 with tip. Beside the price increase the place is small and always crowded. But the people are wonderful and the food is always great.
1,"My boyfriend and I came here and loved it! The meat was juicy and cooked to perfection. The service was normal, no rush and they allowed us to talk and enjoy our dinner as long as we pleased. The warmed up apple pie with Ice cream on the side totally hit the spot!"
1,"i asked the owner if the fish tank was real - the fish seemed too amazing to be real!  but actually, everything in the bar seems too amazing to be real even the varied (and inexpensive!) menu!  and all those beers i've only heard of which will require lots of further investigation.  you'll find me there as often as i can get there.  whoever designed this has an amazing eye and attention to detail, i'm very impressed.  perhaps most impressive is that the bar is confidently, and mercifully, beyond the reaches of the park slope hoi pollio."
0,"Extraordinary! The tavern has a delicious mushroom lasagna, and the dining room vegetarian tasting menu was unbelievable! Wonderful service, but the food steals the show."
1,A great experience overall. Sushi was excellent and Martha Stewart was sitting nearby. That pretty much says it all.
1,"Greek for Chinese New Year dinner, that's my question? Known for Greek cuisine, I wanted to eat here. We were sat pretty quickly and service arrived fairly quickly. The loaf of bread with olive oil was nicely season. That was a good start. I have been craving some Greek yogurt so we ordered a yogurt appetizer. I wasn't raptured as I remember Greek yogurt as being dense, so my plate was ok.  Then came out the lemon potato, which was very interesting, yellow sour potato wedges.  I cannot decide if I like this or not. We also ordered the grilled octopus and fried sardine.  Why did I order the octopus for? This was frozen and recooks, so I did not enjoy it like I wanted to... Having sardine made me think about being in the Mediterranean again. Woo hoo!!! Taste me away please. =) They could be a better presenter as my sardine was stack on top of some lettuce, it didn't allow the sardine to shine and pop. Oh yeah, we got free dessert, so that was good. I think this place is commercialized Greek, cater to everyone and not original Greece to me."
0,"I was brought here by a friend to catch up, but the place was SO loud that it was hard to hear him. The atmosphere was cozy, however, the noise was just too much to handle. The food was good though. Not the best Cuban I have ever had, but definitely worth the price and I would do take out. We started with the fried plantains which had some sort of aioli dipping sauce. We moved on to share a bowl of gazpacho which was mediocre. Our entree was very good. It was a chicken breast with more plantains and mushrooms in a white wine sauce. Overall, the place is good, but just not if you're trying to have a conversation."
0,"good, but i think there are better places for the quantity."
1,"Hidden Gem Alert! So my roommate yelped this place because he was in the mood for some Katsu.  I'm always skeptical of his selections because he'll down right eat anything and be happy with it.  I'm a little more on the 'harder to please' side.  I think everyone that writes reviews on yelp becomes that way after a certain period of time.   ANYWAY.  So this place is in a solid location in midtown.  It's kinda away from the traffic which is always a plus.  You enter.  The place is small (any hidden gem is).  There's probably space for 15 people to sit at a time.  Walk up to the menu, They have few items on the menu, but I was interested in the curry katsu.  They've got 4 different sizes of curry Katsu.  Differentiated in baseball terms (single, double, triple, homerun) to honor the hero of Go Go Curry, Hideki Matsui.  (His face and memorabilia is plastered everywhere) But this place is solid man.  I got the single, and it's a healthy portion of food.  The curry is slightly tangy, with a mild kick to it.  It's good.  With pleasant chunks of meat you'll find like buried treasure.  And it's relatively cheap here!   My recommendation? Go Go get some damn curry now!!"
1,Food selections for the AYCE hotpot is so limited and they don't have enough tables for small parties. My friend and I had to share a private room with 2 other girls and the ventilation was horrible. Other than that the service was good but I won't be returning on my own free will and I don't even want to try the Korean BBQ which I smelled a lot of people burning their food. Also the beef was super frozen which I dislike. Hot pot in queens is way better with more food selections that come with the AYCE.
1,I hear the chicken and waffles are great! Will update my review once I try it out however I have tried the chicken wings and they are tasty! Vibe and decor is dope!
0,"Best coal fired pizza we have had in New York!  Excellent wait staff, quick friendly service.  Located under the Brooklyn Bridge. This pizza place is owned by the original Grimaldi's owner, Patsy Grimaldi.  Ironically the store Patsy sold, along with his name, is still operating next door, providing a choice of pizzeria's under the bridge.."
0,There is very little I can say about this place that hasn't been said.  It's worth a visit for the sheer value if nothing else.
1,"I think some people come here because people have written about it, bourdain has been in it, and paul giamatti was a regular before he was famous (you can read an article on their door).  It is the kind of place you walk into, share tables with strangers, and eat.  there are some things that seem so so cheap (like the rice dishes could feed two!), and the delicious noodle soups.  we also ordered a wide noodle, which wasn't as wide as expected.  Regardless, it was tasty but it wasn't something I would rave over. it was good and I will definitely be back, but perhaps I didn't order what was intended. service was surprisingly good, and you get oranges at the end. beers are 3 bucks and there are a mix of tourists and chinese which tells me that this food has to be good to some degree.  i will go again, perhaps order some duck or crab next time.  I really think you can't go wrong with noodle soup though!"
1,"Things I liked: 1. The really grumpy old Italian guy who is in charge of the line/tables. Maybe I've watched a few too many episodes of Sopranos, but I could kind of see him smacking someone around for messing up an order, or comping a pizza to the local don. Anyway, it made me happy. 2. The cheese. Fresh mozzarella..yum. 3. The pizza comes out SO quickly. Which is nice, since you usually have to stand outside forever to get a table. Things I didn't like: 1. The line and the waiting. 2. The expectations! It was not the best pizza in New York. It was good pizza.. but one side of our crust was burnt, and I do not like burnt pizza. I'd go back..if the line is shorter. And I second the advice about the Brooklyn Ice cream Factory. Or maybe just skip to dessert..."
0,"I am almost embarrassed to say I had never been to this NYC chestnut before but I went recently with two buddies and it really delivered.  We actually did not find it expensive sompared to other restaurants we've been to recently.  We had a nice bottle of Brouilly.  I  had a green salad to start and a wonderful trout fillet with what I think were leeks.  It was utterly delicious and the textures were perfect.  one of my buddies had the hanger steak, which he said was great, and the other had the rabbit on pappardelle, which he also said was excellent. The service was professional, friendly and efficient.  We showed up on a busy night without a resevration but were treated very well. I'll defintitely be back."
1,"I'd passed Coppelia numerous times on my treks to and from the nearby 14th Street Station without giving it much thought. On the outside, it looks like your typical 24-hour diner, but looks can be deceiving. I've been to Coppelia numerous times as they're ideal for any meal for the day, and their decor is fairly colorful, simple and clean - reminiscent of an old-school diner. The menu is on a printed sheet of paper that also acts as a table covering; although it was fairly compact, the range of options spans across the more breakfast-like foods to the heartier sandwiches and main courses. The Cuban influence is pretty evident in the offerings; it's a menu that seemed to fuse together Latin-American, traditional American, and even Korean elements. One of their more popular dishes, the Mac & Chicharron is Coppelia's rendition of the classic Mac & Cheese dish. Although the portion is a bit small for two people, it's actually pretty hearty. The macaroni is cooked to a slightly past al dente texture, the cheese perfectly applied, and the addition of pork belly and chicharron adds a savory, meaty flavor to each bite. While I wish it had been baked slightly longer to add even more of a crispness to the edges, I appreciate the sprinkling of red pepper flakes and green onion on top to bring out even more flavors. My standard go-to is the Cubano Sandwich. You have the option of adding a side for an additional several dollars, and the fries (potato, sweet potato, and Yuca) are all solid, dependable bets. The Cubano sandwich, on the other hand, is one of the best I've found in New York The bread is perfectly crisped, chewy, and has the perfect ratio of roasted shredded pork, ham, and swiss cheese, and is finished off with slices of tomato and mustard. I can't help but be amazed at how something so simple can be done so well and so consistenty. It's a dish I've ordered multiple times, and for good reason. Coppelia is far from your typical diner. While the decor and the service aren't particularly noteworthy, the food is tasty, reasonably priced, and available at any hour of the day and night."
1,"Quite the opposite experience compared to other yelpers. Setting was extremely laid back (timing perhaps?), and all interactions went smooth. My partner in crime & I showed up 30 mins prior to our reserved time & we were accommodated. No fuss as mentioned in other reviews. The chef/owner even knew my name without looking. We ordered, with a suggestion from the counter person, opened our bottle of wine & waited in anticipation. I loved everything. Antipasta had no chance of survival & was quickly devoured. My P.I.C and I then shared 3 entrees. All delish. I thank the chef/owner & she thanked me back. Saying it's a pleasure to have nice people. Idk what the hell others have done to agitate this woman but she was delightful to us, as was the staff. I'm coming back without a doubt."
1,"So good! The bread for the sandwiches is amazing if you decide you want to eat your meat with it. The burned ends baked beans were so good! Their fries are served ala pomme frites without the sauces. Pulled pork & burned ends are both equally delicious. Not too fatty and not too ""well done"""
0,"Great place with really good atmosphere. Food is delicious. The staff are friendly and professional. Responsive and overall quite knowledgeable. But we did feel a bit rushed. This place is great for dates and for get a together with friends. However don't forget to get yourself a reservation. This place is popular and gets crowded most of the times. Also bring some cash, cause this place doesn't accept credit cards. It's very weird to see a cash only place now days, but it is what it is."
0,Best sashimi and sushi in the area!
0,Amazingly delicious. Service is good too. Nice outside garden area (considering the location). Queens really does have the best thai food.
0,"I came there with a party of 10!  My friends came in from out of town and were completely blown away. The food was on point, I was temped to nearly lick my plate and when I looked over down our table my friends were swiping their fingers on the plate ,just to lick the sauce off! Lol, Amazing is all I can say! Best restaurant in Brooklyn, hands down. All the specialty drinks are made with organic fresh fruits! Need I say more? Things you must try are Wings Fried Oysters Mussels Shrimp and Lobster Grits Salmon Whole Fish with dirty rice Mac and cheese"
0,On vacation. It was great. We all four left the table happy. What a great thing!  Very limited menu. No salads. Cash only.
1,"This place was a GREAT find. Very small and quaint but I didn't have to wait for a table. The room has exposed brick and wooden tables and seats and the lighting is pretty dim (candle lit dinner). Food - we got A LOT of food (onto the good stuff): PAPPA AL POMODORO (Tuscan soup of tomatoes, bread and basil topped with fresh ricotta.  Served warm) : This soup was the first part of the meal we tried. It was very thick but so good. The mix of the different ingredients really goes well together. POLPETTINE DELLA TOSCA (beef meatballs): among the best meatballs I've had. There were 6 of them in a tomato-like sauce. We dipped these in the tuscan soup (above) and it was heavenly. Each meatball was about 1 inch in diameter STRISCE ALLA CHIANTIGIANA  (pasta strips with pork cheek and a wine sauce): I am not a pork eater but I was (semi) forced to try it and it was surprisingly really good. The pasta and wine sauce though was the best part. Cooked to perfection and (again) a great blend of different tastes. PESCE DEL GIORNO(fish of the day we went was snapper): Never had snapper before and it was so good! Not over cooked, not under cooked. LINGUINE CON RAGÙ DI CODA DI ROSPO (pasta with monkfish): unfortunately we did not get to spend as much time on this dish (as it came last). The fish was a new fish and was a bit chewey-er than other that I've had, but the dish was still really good. Everything was prepared SOO nicely! Service: The service was IMPECCABLE. I drink water very quickly and not once did I have to ask for more. They were all over our table. Additionally, our food came out very quickly. I would definitely come back here. It is relatively casual and can be for anything from dates, to family dinners, to eating by yourself."
0,"Very nice atmosphere , good was awesome price was right very  nice employees."
0,"Being on my own meant I skipped the queue on a Sunday and ate at the bar. Delicious feta and spinach omelette and fantastic home fries. This is an extremely popular place and I can see why. Even though busy, you are not rushed. Friendly team. Also went Friday early afternoon and sat outside which makes for great people watching."
1,"Quick service, massive portions, at a low price. Be careful with the laser hot red sauce, but this is two meals for 6$. Only caution is don't try the falafel. It tastes spoiled or just off...and there's plenty of amazing restaurants nearby which specialize in New York brand falafel you should try instead."
0,Pizza was AMAZING!!! My mother and I had the garlic & basil while my brother and step-dad had pepperoni. The chef came out personally to deliver the pizza and we stayed and talked a lot. VERY FRIENDLY!!! The room was not all that spacious.  We were lucky to get seats. The environment is full of friendly people who are willing to help tourists. It serves everything from breakfast to desserts to hot chocolate. An OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD experience.
0,"Like brunch at authentic brunch places? Penelope is for you. Good food, not too over priced and good service. Also great if you like to wait for 30 minutes to be seated! Hey, it's a popular place and it's in Manhattan...what do you expect? Enjoy a complimentary cup of coffee or tea while you wait. Don't like waiting, come early. I recommend the Spinach Pie (more like an egg Spanakopita). Poached eggs with smoked salmon is also a winner. Add fresh squeezed OJ, a coffee and some good friends and you've got the ingredients for a great morning."
0,T-bone steak was to die for.. Staff is very friendly
1,"I absolutely LOVE Busters! I work right across the street from this tiny little restaurant and go at least once every week. I like everything I order, and I mean everything. Their food comes from a little farm in New Jersey which the owner visits frequently. Local ingredients, hooray! The staff is super friendly and attentive and will answer any and all questions you have about their food and where it is sourced from. I highly recommend this place if you are nearby! The only downside is that the interior is so small, but they recently renovated, making room for two more tables. Still, if you go right at lunchtime there may not be room to eat. Just get it to go and enjoy!!"
1,I love you Ippudo.  Your broth is yummy and flavorful.  The noodles are so fresh.  It's like a little orgasm in my mouth.  It is WONDERFUL.  Please come to Chicago!  Next time I'm going to ask for an extra serving of pork belly.
0,"Came here last year with friends from Colorado. We had a great time with a nice bottle of wine and some great pasta, fish and chicken dishes. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to it, slightly romantic, with excellent service."
0,"It's your classic small spot in NYC. There's a great bar scene upstairs and tables all around. It's good food-- the shoestring french fries are delicious! And a nice selection of appetizers and drinks. I thought it was too crowded on a Sunday-- so if you like crowds, you'll love this place. If you want to move around without hitting people, maybe go on weeknights or earlier than most crowds show up!"
0,"It seems every time I am in  SOHO to shop I have to come to eat here. I simply love it! I will not venture to try anything else period. Which drives my husband even more crazy than my spending habits. We've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and always enjoy it. The only con is it's hard to get in, you need to make reservations well in advance, but you won't be disappointed. There is also a bakery next door that has pastries and sandwiches that also gets very busy but worth the wait. If you're in SOHO it's worth a stop."
0,"We wish Caesar can rise again just because ""Julius the server"" is so amazing! Not only is he incredibly attentive, but also made an extra effort to protect his patrons from bar creepers. Aside from the great food and drinks, Julius is the best part of the establishment. Be our BFF?"
0,cool place...cool people
1,"Love this place.  It's normally a bit of a wait, but they'll take down your number and text you as soon as your table is ready, so you can leave and get a drink at one of the many cocktail bars in the area. Service is fast and friendly, which I appreciate.  My husband and I normally get the crawfish and shrimp special, which for only $25, is a huge amount of food.  The last time we came here we couldn't even finish the remaining few crawfish we had left in the bag.  But so, so good. It's cash only, so be prepared for that.  Love this place."
1,"The bartenders here are true mixologists. I came with a fairly large party and each of our drinks were stellar. The Ginger Smash and Quiet Storm were my faves. The place was packed for a Wednesday night, but the bartenders kept the energy flowing--it never felt too claustrophobic. I was hoping for a slightly more secluded speakeasy feel, and it was more hole-in-the-wall Greenwich Village lounge energy. That said, the overall vibe was good and the drinks top-notch. I'll totally be back with a smaller party."
0,"I've lived in Thailand for the last 8 1/2 years and this is the closest I've found to the real Isaan taste in the Hell's Kitchen area; I'd say in Manhattan but I haven't been to Zaab Eely yet.  I had typical Isaan stuff -- nam tok moo, larb ped, and som tam Thai, all with sticky rice -- and they pretty much nailed it.  My friends also really loved it, and they have only eaten that Americanized central Thai cuisine that most restaurants serve.  I don't live in the HK area but i will definitely be going back."
1,"This is my 300th Yelp review and I am pleased to be reviewing 99 Favor Taste. All you can eat hotpot AND korean bbq for 30$ OR unlimited bbq for 25$ OR unlimited hotpot for 20$. Of course we do both, and it was perfect. They cook the BBQ while you cook in your hotpot. Meats are excellent quality, you can get kalbi, house marinated steak, pork belly, lamb, just like any other place like this but the flavor here is unparalleled. The other thing to note here is that the decor here is probably one of the best for a Chinese restaurant. Seriously looks like a 5 star Chinese restaurant, and by far the nicest looking one that I have seen in Manhattan. They can accommodate very large parties, and there is a ton of space. DEFINITELY GET RESERVATIONS or be prepared to wait +2 hrs in prime time. No drinks besides the water so thats unlike Hou Yi hotpot where you can have unlimited soft drinks and sweet teas and juices and ice cream. However if you check in on Yelp you can get a scoop for free as you walk out the door."
0,"Eh....the pizza's definitely made to order with ingredients that you can taste as being fresh, however it's nothing to write home about.  The crust is great, sauce is basic, and cheese is ok.  We ordered ours with pepperoni and mushrooms and even though there was a decent amount of pepperoni on it, the mushrooms were overpowering.  Had to try Lombardi's once but won't be going back since there's plenty of fantastic pizza in the city."
0,"I don't understand why this place isn't packed?!  It was about 2/3 full on a Saturday evening at 8:00 pm.  No problem in getting a table.     The food was excellent as was the service.  The prices are modest.  The decor...well as someone said, not very Parisian....but  charming enough and they were playing a fun assortment of French music.   We had the onion soup.  The soup was buttery from the slow cooking of the onions and the cheese on top was tasty and appropriately browned.  The crab salad, also excellent.  Real lump crab....very nice. For main course, we had the flounder and the hanger steak.  The flounder was well cooked and the medley of sauteed veggies were perfectly al dente and well seasoned.  The hanger steak was cooked to perfection and the the garlicy sauce was yummy. For dessert we shared the profitteroles.  The ice cream was creamy.  My only negative comment...the chocolate sauce was a little thin, but it tasted very very good...dark chocolate, not too sweet and excellent complement to the ice cream. All in all a delightful experience--great food, very moderate prices, attentive service, and an acceptable (but small) wine list.....I would definitely go back.   Just hope they don't close any time soon!!!!"
1,"Delicious burgers day or night with french fries that seem to be laced with nicotine. I've stopped here for a quick late lunch and for happy hour and have been very pleased by some satisfying burgers. At first, I felt like the burger looked small. But it was more than enough. I've had the Billy Burger with bacon as well as Two-8-Two. Try them all and try them often."
1,"Definitely get the gyoza. It's so crunchy and light. It's very different from other places I've had gyoza at. The hot pots are great on cold days .. well .. it wasn't an especially cold day when I went but sweating is healthy right? So I got the Hakata Ton Ton hot pot and it was, I admit, seemingly deceptive. It looked huge at first but the veggies really do boil down and it's a good portion size. The broth was flavorful (a bit salty I thought) but it was good nonetheless. I did wish there was more meat though. It was lacking a bit in the protein section as I only got a few slices of pork belly and feet. I never did tell my date what I called the ""secret meat"" was. I don't think he would've scarfed it down if he knew it was pig feet. He thought it was pork belly, silly boy. Overall, great place. I think it'd be a lot more fun coming here with a bigger group and the service was so warm and friendly. As we left, one of the waitresses stopped us and gave us a pez candy from her piggy pez dispenser and I thought that was the most adorable thing ever."
0,"This is an excellent place and we had the benefit of staying just around the corner. When we walked in, it was quite noisy. And this was a week night. Place was packed. We ate upstairs which was a little quieter, but not much. Then again, I can put up with noise when you have great food. Service was unpretentious but attentive. What was good? What wasn't! If you like garlic, you must try the garlic chile spaghetti. Outstanding! We split it as an appetizer after the grilled peach salad. The sea bass was good, but the char was really good. And the olive oil cake was delicious. We were stuffed when we left, but had to try as much as we could. It was worth it."
1,"One of the best brunch experiences I have had but I'm sure its not for everyone. It's packed, you will have to wait 20min-1 hr for a table for two and you might end up eating at the bar. This is not the kind of place you want to come with a big group to. The place is packed like sardines.  That being said....You feel like you really are in France. Super authentic down to the waiters french accent to the wines. It feels ok to have a glass of red wine at noon because your in Paris! The eggs with prociutto were delicious and I think one of the most popular dishes. My boyfriend is vegetarial and enjoyed that they had a vegetarian alternative to the croque monsieur with mushrooms. It was super flavorful and packed with herbs. Great sunday afternoon in Paris!"
1,"We came here for the first time after wanting to try if for years.   Love the minimalist decor.  Service was superb.  The crispy calamari had a unique citrusy sauce, although a bit salty it was very tasty.  The salmon was perfect with the crispest baby bok  choy and of course,  Jean Georges molten chocolate cake never disappoints!  Worth a trip West..."
0,great place to get street meat. it's the sauce that makes it.
1,"Fantastic coffee and Bahn Mi, and the staff is always friendly."
0,"Never thought that $5 a slice would be so worth it! I was so skeptical at first, thinking,  ""what can make a slice of pizza so special?"" The ingredients are super fresh and its not like any other pizza you have tasted before."
0,"We came to NY for the weekend and ended up coming here twice during our stay. We first came for lunch, which turned out to be very good, both food and drinks were great (and reasonably priced too). The location is perfect...near Bryant park, Times Square and fifth avenue.  The decor is much more upscale than we expected, and so when we were looking for a drink the next night we came back. The place was full, but  not so crowded we were overlooked. In fact, we were served our drinks quickly and had a great time. Next time I'm in the city, I will definitely come back."
0,"Dining at Theresa's Place was a great experience, From the beautiful plate presentations to the great tasting food.  I was very impressed with this quaint and cute restaurant.  I had the wonderful pleasure to meet the owners and they made me feel right at home.  If you haven't had a chance to experience it for yourself, give it a try. Two thumbs up all the way."
0,I had their special pot pie with stout that made in real Vanilla bean.  It was amazing and it is a must visit destination.
1,"So I started going here after a friend of mine suggested we go. I went and yes, at that time was kinda impressed. I liked the lighting. Its a bit dim and the music is good. Now after going quite a few times I have found that there are things I dont necessarily like about it anymore. First...the people this place attracts. They are rude. And most likely out for blood when I sat this I mean out for the blood of .....a FEmale. Most of the patrons here are eager professionals looking for a good ,drunk hot female. And THEIR OBVIOUS about it. This I think cheapens the place. Quite a bit. I know thats what the bar scene is all all about but its almost ,too intense here. The music is good, actually. There is some ""art"" on the walls. Its....mediocre. The service, great. I have a favorite bartender here. He's very attentive to all the patrons. The location, good. although from outside it looks like a total shady hole."
0,"BURRITOS ~ 10LBs LATER ~ BURRRIIITTTTOOOOSSSS I came to Habana outpost for the first time last week after a long day of service. My team and I were ready to eat something spicy then drink liquor so that our saliva can turn to flames!! It didn't work but we had some great and not semi okay food.  It was a semi warm day and they have a nice outdoor sitting area. We must have gotten there just in time for the lunch rush because the line was out the building. It took 25 minutes for us to order our food. FYI I am the type of person who offers my food in hopes that you will then offer some of yours so I can taste everyone's food. It usually works. Anyways, I ordered the chicken burrito but everything I tasted was as follows: Guacamole and Queso sandwich, Catfish burrito, cheese quesadilla, Grilled corn, Roscoe on a stick (chicken and waffles), and the frozen Margarita. Now I did not enjoy my chicken burrito. It was way too dry for my liking. The rice had no flavor and I hate the taste of charbroiled meat.  It is pretty much case closed on that chicken burrito. BUT that catfish burrito!!!! What... That burrito was delish. Idk what it was but it was filled with flavor. I mean I only had a bite (or two) but it gets a thumbs up. The cheese quesadilla and guacamole and queso chicken was tasty but that roscoe on a stick!!!!! I was in love. Now I might be pregnant because I was craving some chicken and waffles and Habana Outpost did Roscoe proud with that side dish. All in all I had a good experience at Habana and would definitely go back. Here's the menu if you want to see everything they have cafehabana.com/data/down…"
1,"The food is delicious and best of all not too pricey. I've been finding that these days it's hard to find really good restaurants that I can get my dinner companions to agree to that aren't too expensive. The space is designed to resemble a Greek taverna with wood tables and ceramic pots. The store front isn't all that promising though the inside is comfy and inviting. Our server though wasn't quite enamored with us, but that's another story. Maybe it was our overzealous interjections? Oh well, the food was really the highlight anyway. We started with the mezze platter that contained tzatziki, some sort of eggplant dip, and a creamy sun dried tomato herb dip served alongside warm pita bread. The tzatziki was alright, this opinion could be due to the fact that I am not a huge fan of tzatziki. I must admit though I can't remember too much about the eggplant dip other than it was kind of like some sort of eggplant salsa with chopped eggplant and tomatoes as well as spices. The sun dried tomato dip was my favorite. It was creamy and definitely tasted of sun dried tomato as well as herbs. I also tried the Polpette or Meatballs which were small lamb (I presume) meatballs in a tangy tomato sauce. The meatballs were light and fluffy, as well as being juicy and well seasoned. In addition to this we had the Grilled Octopus which I highly recommend. Many times octopus can be very tough and chewy, but the octopus here was tender and buttery, in other words perfection. I could have done wihtout the chickpea salad it came under as the octopus was so outstanding. I sampled the lamb sausages and was wowed. The sausages were grilled and seasoned to perfection with a medley of spices, a must order for those sausage fanatics out there. For the main course I ordered the Sheep's Milk Dumplings. The dumplings are filled with soft creamy sheep's milk cheese and served in a bright chunky tomato sauce with lamb sausage. Though I wasn't a fan of the lamb sausage the dumplings were heavenly. The dumplings were soft pillows of cheesy goodness, while the tangy sauce added mroe flavor depth. Of course for dessert I ordered my ultimate favorite, Rice Pudding. The rice in the rice pudding was a bit too crunchy for my taste. But thye flavor of the pudding itself was great, luscious and creamy. All in all a great place for great food at a decent price."
0,"The best of Paris in lower Manhattan. Not quite La Coupole, but it will never disappoint. Grueyere cheese on onion soup is raison d'etre. Never had a bad dish or experience. Consistently delivers."
1,"I came here for brunch last Sunday, but I have been walking by forever. I always thought it was attached to the restaurant on the corner, opps. Anywho, it was 12 and there was only one other table in sight. This is not the norm of Williamsburg Brunch, its usually a very long wait. This made me happy but then slightly nervous. We sit, our adorable hipster waitress comes over, we get minosa's. They are only $4, but they are pretty small and mine was kinda weak. My friend and I both got the Bananas Foster French toast, fluffy light and so savory and decadent, making me glad I had just come from the gym.Very good sized portion. Usually I take issue with restaurants putting syrup on my food, it always feels like the wrong amount, But they did it perfectly here. My only problem with this meal was the lack of bananas, they skimped. I like this place, great layout and a 7min walk from the J/M/Z about half that on the L line. Really clean bathroom, super friendly staff. Worth another visit, wanna check out that dinner menu."
1,This place is amazing!  Try the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  It is to die for.  The sommelier was fantastic and chose wonderful wine for us after asking a little about our preferences.  The staff was warm and attentive. The location is great.  We went here prior to seeing a show on Broadway. I highly recommend checking Ai Fiori out if you are in the area! I will be back next time I am in New York.
0,"Good solid Italian in a more vibrant young crowd in the UES. If you were to take Lusardis and UVA, then your Italian craving would be covered on 78th st. The 2 complements one another as they both serve quality Italian to different age demographics. Both definitely wont disappoint."

1,Follow John B's advice--all of it. Late night at Great NY Noodletown is neither the time nor the place for preciousness. Enjoy it for what it is. Thank it that it is open 24 hours. Eat some roast pork and drink free-flowing tea.
1,The best burger I have ever eaten! But the most expensive... I absolutely loved the atmosphere. IOne of my favourite restaurants in NY.
1,"One late evening around 2am, I sat at the bar at Bubby's, watching birthday parties, post-night at the bar munchers, staff at other restaurants, and tourists come and go from Bubby's. That's the fun of being at a 24-hour place that can accommodate huge groups and actually has good food. In one gluttonous visit, I sampled the cherry pie, chocolate peanut butter pie, red velvet cupcake, and yellow cupcake with chocolate frosting. Oddly, they ran out of the one thing I really wanted to try, the banana cream pie (I ended up getting my banana pudding fix at Magnolia's). I will have to come back for it. In a huge surprise to me because I don't actually like cherry pie, the cherry pie was by far my favorite. Fresh cherries are soooo good. Several of the staff shared that the chocolate peanut butter pie was their favorite, but I thought it was way too sweet (says the girl who had 4 desserts in  one sitting). I think there's a bit of an identity crisis going on, where Bubby's can't decide if it's catering to large families from out-of-town, or local New Yorkers who want a comfortable and solid place to go, but, either way, it's go-to place for this neighborhood."
1,"One of the best meal experiences I have ever had. Having to acclimate to a complex set of new dietary restrictions recently has made going out to eat more than challenging. Gramercy Tavern, however, made me and my entire party completely forget that I ever had to watch what I was eating. Not only were they able to accommodate gluten-free diets (which, though trendier these days, can still present a challenge), but they created an entire custom tasting menu to accommodate the MANY rather key ingredients that I could not have. Having arrived to the restaurant expecting a piece of plainly cooked fish and bland vegetables (usually the only way I can manage to still enjoy socializing over dinner), I was in no way expecting to enjoy a multi-course tasting menu completely safe for me to eat and incredibly flavorful. The service was above and beyond all of our expectations, and the quality of the food matched the impeccable service. Gramercy Tavern lives up to their reputation."
0,"I cant say anything bad at all. The food is consisten, the girls are phenomenal and Joel at the bar is so good. I feel like home anytime I go there. Number one spot in the UES."
1,"Dear Saki Bar Hagi, I'm so happy that there is a tastey and delicious, fun restaurant so close to my boyfriends theater where we can get a late night snack!  I must have been 3 or 4 times in the past month.   Hmmm....pork belly, steamed clams, yellow tail collar!  All a cumulative food adventure worth the trip!  I love to close my eyes and point at the decadent creations on the menu while ordering for fun.  Lets see what I get!? Thanks Hagi!  See you again soon! XO Penni"
0,"Not your ordinary Japanese dining experience. Tofu, vegetarian, pork, chicken, lamb-chops all cooked robataya style. Grilled in front of your eyes, absolutely delicious! The atmosphere is not great, but the food is well worth it!"
0,"Food is fantastic! Service needs some guidance, check back times, waiters could be tuned by mgmt to be more attentive..  Difficult to find food this level of quality so close to home w out paying $$$$$ @ at $$$ prices... Love this place!"
1,Absolutely delicious. The falafel was a little dry that day but good lord that white sauce and that rice...
0,"I've only eaten here once even though I live on the same block, and maybe I should try it again because the food I had  was not nearly as good as I expected it to be. ( I have a friend who comes to town just to eat here, and the reviews are glowing so I expected to be blown away.) First of all the bread was not fresh totally stale and tasted like cheap grocery store bread, which to me is a bad way to start a meal. I ordered the pasta with capers and anchovies and that's all I had. It was so dense and greasy I couldn't eat much of it. The capers and anchovie sauce was salty and tangy and I actually loved that part of it, but all in all the experience  was just ok. Maybe it was an off night but I was underwhelmed."
0,"I pass by this place one my way to yoga almost everyday. it looks quiet nice from outside.. last night I decided to give it a try. I like the decor, good for date, small or large group. I'm not an italian food expert.. to me the food was just so-so.. it also could be I wasn't super hungry Service was friendly and fast. I'm not too crazy about this place. It's alright to my taste !!"
1,"Never would I have imagined myself writing a yelp review complaining about a restaurant but thought the need to after receiving the worst customer service of my life at this place. My friend and I came in around 1:30pm on Saturday, waited about 30 minutes and got seated. We didn't get our water until 20 minutes in, finally having to ask the waitress for it. No one came by to ask how things were--okay whatever, it's Saturday brunch in NYC. It's busy, we get it. But you can clearly see the servers just chilling on the side together, sipping on coffee, chit-chatting. It was pretty hard to get their attention. We got our food on a decent pace (thank yous to the kitchen!) and almost took 10 minutes to get a server by us to ask for the check. After paying, one of the girls came by and asked if everything was okay and how service was. We told her honestly saying that it was pretty slow. She responded saying that it IS Saturday and brunch time. My friend mentioned some of the servers talking, standing, drinking coffee on the side. She says ""okay"" and walks away. When she came back to drop off our change, she states ""why don't you guys try being on your feet for 9 hours"" in the nastiest and rudest tone of voice ever. The more ironic thing is I'm a server myself and the friend I came with is a cook at a very fast-paced restaurant. Food was nothing more than mediocre. I've had much better avocado toast at Joseph Leonard. Baked eggs with sausage were too overcooked in our opinion. Smoked trout salad was bland. Definitely not worth a second visit especially with the service from hell."
1,"Phenomenal!!  The pappardelle with sweet sausage and truffle was close to the best Italian dish I've ever had!  Everything about this place was 5 star, all at reasonable prices!"
0,"I have eaten at Westville over twenty times. Impeccable service. Fast take-out. Reliable delivery. Delicious food! The only con is that Westville is always packed. It's not a first date place because it's loud, but it's my go-to spot to catch up with friends. It is well worth your money to buy three sides for $15 bucks. My favorites: -Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken -Veggie Burgers -Sweet Potato fries are to die for! -Pies/Carrot Cake"
0,"This place went from cool to douchey overnight.  When it opened, it had a real feel of a neighborhood pub - everyone was nice, friendly and laid back.  They started getting more popular, and now it feels like any other middle off the road pub in nyc.  Really disappointing.  We live around the corner and had high hopes. Good comfort food, but you will be hard-pressed to find any alternatives for healthier-minded friends.  The Peacok upstairs has beautiful rooms,,,or will when it opens fully."
0,Wow I cant get enough of this placeeee!  hot pizza on a cold day :)
1,"my date and i ate 'just enough' and weren't too surprised by the bill, less than $200. the fish was spectacular but japanese sized, like the difference between a lexus and a ford, all in the quality. the waiter was especially helpful in recommending plates and was utterly not pretentious. i loved the bare, yellow wood dining room---fantastically simple and casual but very, very serious (about the fish)."
0,"What can I say?  Everyone from the bartenders, to servers, to the chefs are some of the nicest staff I've encountered in a restaurant in a long time!  I've been here a few times now and have loved every minute of all my visits.  The tuna pizza at the bar is amazing!  And $5 for the bread and butter is worth it!  Hand down the best butter I have ever had!  The truffles they add to it are mouthwatering, and the bread is just as good!  The cocktails are as fabulous as the truffle better and I still think about the white peach sorbet I had over a month ago.  Hand down one of the best I ever had!  I can say I prefer Prospect to a lot of 5 star restaurants I have been to in Manhattan recently, and this is cheaper!"
0,"At a recent birthday party with my lovely girlfriend and friends we hoped to enjoy our night full of laughter and memories that would have lasted us a life time.  The latter is true but our memory will be filled with remorse. Now it is unfair to make that type of statement without any facts, so here they are: 1st- The waiting.  When you enter you are greeted with the old adage, ""is your party here"" , no was our reply, so we were told to wait by the door until all members were present.  No invitation to the bar or a simple how many of our party was missing.   2nd- Drink!- As I discovered the bar all on my own,  I had to discovered my own table as well.   3rd- Pricing- exactly my point, none was available. 4th-Loud- I wasn't looking for a night at Webster Hall I was looking for a night with great food and friends.  I asked the waiter, if he could lower the music he said of course and nothing was done 5th- Food- ehhh Final thought- As a member of my community and someone who approves and disapproves liquor licenses.  I will be sure to vote no next time the Diner comes for renewal."
1,Kebabs are delicious!  Highly recommend.  The weather was perfect so we sat in the garden which is cute and charming.  We will be back as soon as they secure their liquor license :)
0,"I used to go there regularly for brunch.  But quality of food lately has been quite bad.  After waiting 45 minutes for a table when we were told the wait time would only be 20 minutes, we gave up and seated ourselves at the bar.   Potato waffles were cooked in dirty oil that was way overdue for a change and the eggs were dry and not seasoned."
0,"Caught the Tribeca Film Festival and watched 2 documentaries and a LMAO hip comedy.  Had fun, but needed some air after that.  Walked over to the North End Grill for some seafood.  Service was a bit slow, but the buttery lobster was worth waiting for.  Yum."
1,"I went to Ilili this past Sunday for brunch. Their prix-fixe menu was impressive and I was really happy with my order: Chakchouka Eggs in Cocotte: spicy tomato sauce, three poached eggs, hash brown dumplings, arugula salad, grilled beets with honey butter, fresh-squeezed OJ, and hot, fluffy pita bread. Bonus - check in on Four Square and the chef will send out a free drink (during lunch/dinner) or mini dessert (during brunch)!"
1,"This is by far one of my favorite Brunch spots to date. I had a Birthday Brunch here when I was turning 22. Everyone who came, whether they were a drinker or not, left here on cloud 9! They absolutely loved the Bottomless Sangria. The best part about the Sangria is that you have 8 different options to choose from which is GREAT (considering most brunch spots only give you the option of bloody mary, mimosas or bellinis)!!! The best thing to order when you go there is the VACA FRITA STEAK! Other than that, everything else on the brunch menu is a bit ehh if you ask me. After going here, I've been on the hunt for a good brunch spot and I'm still searching. My motto for brunch now-- ""If it aint Bottomless, it aint Brunch!"""
0,"a very cool place to grab a bite to eat.  the menu is pretty inventive with some nice old school classics.  the place is definitely happening.  they are open pretty late, so anyone coming out of the clubs and are hungry, you can definitely stop by to feed your cravings."
0,"I've been to this Thai spot numerous times and have always been satisfied. Food is great, atmosphere/decor is great, service is great."
0,"There is no restaurant in Park Slope, Bay Ridge or on Smith Street that can compare to this place.  It's around the corner from me and it's like an answered prayer.  For as many restaurants as there are in Bay Ridge, most of them are for the steak and hamburger crowd.  The delicate flavorings and freshness of the food at Petit Oven are an amazing addition to this neighborhood.  (They even make their own butter.)  The service is fine.  I eat there once a week and have never had to try and get the servers attention, and the chef is usually the one to come out and ask you if you're enjoying your food.  Don't ask for pepper or extra cheese in this place!  Cat, the chef, tastes the food 4 times before it gets to your table.    The food here is wholesome and for more refined palates.  If you're looking for the biggest steak you can find, or a big messy chicken or shrimp parmesan (ugh--who invented that dish anyway?)--this is not the place for you.  For $35 the tasting menu of appetizer, entree and dessert leave a normal appetite more than satisfied, and is a bargain when you consider the quality and ingredients.  Great wine list and even the background music is wonderfully unique."
0,"I went to Woodrows for lunch today and had their beer and a burger for ten dollar special.  The place was really cute and the burger was huge. I would highly recommend trying that place out. But if you do go, you have to try the parmesan truffle fries. They are amazing, as are their mushrooms. Plus the waitress really made me feel at home."
1,"A while back, I was searching for a place near my apartment to have breakfast before a flight and decided upon Ai Fiori. Firstly, the setting is fantastic even though I was a tad confused at first when I entered the Setai. The place offered a quaint environment in which I could enjoy my breakfast and have a calm conversation with my friend. Service was great as well. Attentive but not overbearing or intrusive. Just how I like it. I ordered the Lobster Benedict and was honestly a little disappointed. It was satisfactory but I was hoping to be blown away. Overall, expectations were met but not exceeded."
1,One of the best tasting hamburgers I've ever had (and I am a bit of a burger snob). Bun could use some work but the burger makes it well worth the visit. I've had everything on their menu minus the grilled cheese. Everything is really tasty. Great BLT. Great hotdogs (a bit messy though). Good selection of beer. Great cocktails. Sometimes they can be a little grumpy but most good burger places I've been to are kind of like that (the grumpiness gets the burgers out quicker and better I think).
0,"For $40 two people can get highly salted scrambled eggs (why? maybe because there was no salt and pepper on the table), cold bacon, grits that arrive with a skin on top (microwaved first, with the bacon... and left sitting) and, for some reason, a sad little pile of lettuce and a dish of ketchup (for the lettuce?). If you pay $60 maybe someone will offer a second cup of coffee."
0,Good place for drinks and a horrible place to eat.
1,Extremely disappointed as this place is I overrated. Service is good but the quality control is lacking in their end product. Most of my order was fat and end bits. I know there is fat involved in any BBQ/smoked meats -for flavor- but not when 85%-90%  of something you ordered is fat- and that's aside from the bone (note: do not order the lamb breast as it is only bone and fat with no meat). Only decent thing was the brisket. For the price it should be better. It's more a 'concept' restaurant- with the cafeteria style serving and picnic tables. Kitchy but better bbq and fun elsewhere.
0,Had this the other day.  Fabulous.  I'll be back.
0,"I live 'round the corner from this amazing establishment - not only is the food amazing, the people who run the rabbithole are the most welcoming...the atmosphere paired with the delicious food and friendly staff make the rabbithole an absolutely pleasurable experience each time . I know most people who patron rabbithole are familiar with their amazing brunch menu but i would also try out their DINNER MENU! the FISH n' CHIPS are AMAZING! Their fried oysters and rabbithole salad are also a favorite of mine. I also have to give a shout out to the amazing pastries at rabbithole. wow. the scones are yummy - the sugar that caramelizes on the bottom of the scones....soo good and their chocolate espresso brioche rolls are so moist and kinda melt in your mouth (a good brioche is really hard to find!) - soooo check this place out and try the dinner menu too!"
0,"In a word? Stupendous! I enjoyed this place thorougly and in order to keep my excitement organized, I'll break this into categorizes. FOOD: Can food be orgasmic?  Oh man this stuff was goooood.  Ok so I started with the mussels and when I ordered our lovely French waitress (who I have a girl crush on now...more in the Service section of this review) suggested I go with the Moules Rochelaises (Steamed Mussels with Curry, Diced Apples and Light Cream) hmmm curry, cream and apple? weird right? Boy was I wrong, these were delish!  Such a unique combination, like an explosion of flavors in your mouth.  I took her advice on the Entree as well and got the Scallops, which were seared to perfection.  Along with your Entrees, they bring out a long skinny plate with three sides: sauteed spinach, heavenly mashed potatoes and pureed carrots = yum, yum and yum!   Ok now for the best part, drum roll please....DESSERT. This is a must, seriously kids, save some room, it's worth it.  If you get one thing, get the rand Profiteroles au ""Bittersweet"" Chocolat .  The waitress said a man once described this as ""Hot, cold, bitter and sweet...just like life"" and he pretty much nailed it.  The fusion of temperatures and flavors is superb to the last bite. SERVICE: Best I've had.  Our waitress was so cute, friendly and helpful.  Not to mention she had this French accent that just made everything she said seem more...glamorous.  The owner made it a point to walk around a few times throughout the night to make sure people were enjoying themselves and the food (which everyone was of course).  People knew him by name and as they were leaving hugs and kisses were thrown around like nobody's business which just added to the authenticity of the place once again.  He's great about reading Yelp reviews, in fact, I hear he's changed the menu around for us a couple times. AMBIANCE: Very French.  It was small and cluttered, but in a good way, that's what added to the charm. The walls had some great paintings/posters and a few nautical pieces. The kitchen is wide open at the back so you can see and smell all the wonderful things going on.  Note: your clothes will smell after but it's worth it. OTHER: It's BYOB and you should make a reservation unless you come on a weekday before 6pm"
1,"Ok ok, we broke down and did the tourist thing...since our wait was *only* about 20 minutes, I'd say it was totally worth it. Their service is nothing mentionable, but sort of adds to the experience- they know how great the pizza is, so no need to make a big show of hospitality. We got a regular cheese pizza with pepperoni, and it was delicious every bite of the way. Great sauce, fresh mozzarella, and just enough burnt spots to be yummy without overpowering the delicate dough flavor. While it may not be life-changing (we still have yet to get over to Lucali, but Lombardis is comparable to this), its a fun time that you need to do at LEAST once. So break down and be a tourist. :)"
1,One ot my top restaurants in NYC.  Food is fantastic and reasonably priced.   Service is great!
1,"I liked Minca's Veggie Ramen very much especially they made it more spicy for me which i requested and the noodles came with a whole lota tofu.  It was a very good portion too and made me very full. However, i would say that the broth compares poorly to Ippudo's broth and the noodles are more akin to ramen you can get from packaged noodles you can find at the supermarket. The atmosphere is so-so as well and it was pretty crowded when i decided to go on a Friday night.  My party of four had to be split into two, sitting on either side of the high tables window seats. My sis says she prefers Ippudo. I would say so too because i like that atmosphere and those desserts more.  However, i enjoyed the veggie ramen for the plentiful veggies that it contained."
0,"This place is hands down the best Greek restaurant.  We enjoyed everything from seafood to steak.  We are always greeted with a friendly staff and always attentive to what you need.  There is usually a LONG line for dinner, so we try to go for an early dinner or late lunch to beat the crowd.  But you should try to make the time to try this place.  After one visit you will be hooked!"
0,"What an amazing place!  We went on Saturday, March 13, which some of you will remember as one of the wettest and windiest days we've had in some time.  My wife and I were celebrating her birthday with her twin sister and her husband.  But we were all soaked from some attempts to traipse around the city that day.  I got a call from Graffiti around 4 p.m. saying they had a reservation for us available at 7:30 (wow--didn't expect to get in after calling that morning).  We decided to go for it, fighting our instincts to go home and warm up.  And I am so glad we did!! After arriving 20 minutes early, Chef Mehta was still able to seat us!  The quarters were cramped, but the staff were absolutely fabulous--very warm and friendly.  I've never been to a place where the chef plays such an intimate role in serving and chatting you up during the night.   As for the food--it ranks among some of the best I've ever had.  The zucchini hummus pizza, braised pork buns, and chickpea crusted skate were highlights.  For dessert, the warm truffle almond strawberries with pepper ice cream was phenomenal (even in its simplicity).  All this with $25 bottles of wine and great prices on food too.  Wow, I can't wait to go back."
0,"taste good, long queue, good service."
0,The food here is always on point. I love those tuna tartar things. However I've found the staff to be a bit uppitty at times. They're at times pretty cold especially if you're sitting at the bar. The owner seems pretty cool and receptive to feedback though.
1,"Never again will I underestimate chicken and rice in New York again. I always wondered what the big deal was about this place since chicken and rice from all Halal food carts taste the same. Until I tried this. Soft chicken (not the usual tough, over-fried junk), soft fresh pita and go all out on the hot sauce (sometimes white sauce) - you have tasted heaven from New York's street foods. Absolutely brilliant, good for late nights (you will find long lines all night up until 6 am). If you visit New York, try it!"
0,OMG!!! The food is DELISH!!! I LUUUV the Customer Service and the food is DEELISH! I know I said it already but it's awesome and I even spent V-DAY 2012 there with my guy and it was BEAUTIFUL & JUST RIGHT! The prices are just right so is the ambiance BON APETIT
0,"Ordered arepas to go and it was a full course meal wait. Oh, and they were so wack! Elmhurst street vendors have this place beat. Venture out and try the real deal. Front service staff were friendly and apologetic."
0,"Had a wonderful brunch here for my friend's engagement. We made a reservation for 6 and brought our own cake. Not only was the food delicious, it comes with coffee and a mimosa for a very really reasonable price. We stayed 2 two hours with no problems. I will definitely return!"
1,"I am with Mattie G re: gnocchi- it was fantastic. We had a dinner for 15 here recently, and they were very accommodating. Delicious beet salad as well- I'll go back!"
0,"This place is so cozy and romantic, a great place to get some desserts or coffee and to just kick back and relax.  The food is delicious and affordable; I like the lasagna bolognese, tiramisu, and chocolate mud cake. The pie, the wine, and the ambiance all combined to make this a perfect pizza. The atmosphere is friendly and peaceful."
0,"Im still full from the last time i was there and that was like a month ago.....i have eaten everything on that menu ten times over and still counting the food is crazy the jerk chicken,oxtail,fried chicken,curry goat,ecovishe fish (not sure about the spelling)THE GUAVA CHEESE CAKE,BREAD PUDDING,mac and cheese,curry shrimp,calypso shrimp and the list goes on ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!! ! im getting hungry again!!!!!. at least im not the only one who thinks the place is small teeny tiny is a understatement but its really cozzy has a nice little vibe going.

0,"Yes, almost 2,500 reviews for Ippudo... and they're a strong 4 stars but for me they're a serious 5 stars. Best uni i've ever had and amazing amazing rolls... Freshest and tastiest fish and shellfish..."
0,"I dream of Roberta's, day and night."
1,"Pros: -ABSOLUTELY wonderful noodle. definitely try the recommended noddle on the menu. You won't regret. -Great appetizer. -Reasonably priced Cons: -You MUST come at off-peak hours such as 3pm-4pm to avoid the crowd. Or, 30 minute wait time. -small place. people squeeze each other all the time. I go to Fordham Univ. and come to this place often. It is one of my favorite restaurant near Columbus Circle area."
1,It's as if your biting into tiny chunks of heaven. The chefs are amazing the food tastes exactly as it looks delicious. I've been to this resturant numerous times and the staff is so welcoming ! They greet you with a smile and always check up on you throughout your stay. I would highly suggest dressing in dress attire if your thinking of visiting for dinner. The location is great its between 6 and 5th avenue so its never too busy during lunch and dinner time! I highly recommend this resturant
0,"Good happy hour, would definitely visit again!"
1,Place is amazing. The wings are an absolute must. Brisket is amazing and the Mac n cheese is a little different but oh so good
1,"This place is always super busy. If you come by yourself you can get seated almost right away. If not, be prepared to wait about 45 mins to an hour to be seated. No matter how good the ramen, their prices are too high. But they've got the hype and people keep coming so why not. They do have good ramen here. It is definitely worth a visit if you're in the area. Service is excellent here. They always treat you well and make you feel welcomed."
1,one of my favorite places to take my family love the pizza
1,"This place looked so warm and welcoming on a cold winter night that I had to eat there.  We arrived at around 9:00 pm and had no trouble snagging a table.  Service was solicitous. Our waiter hung our coats up for us, which was nice because space was pretty tight.  I ordered the much-vaunted French Onion soup and the frisee salad w/ lardon; hubby ordered the same soup and the vegetable crepe.   The soup looked perfect, and was rich and flavorful, but way too salty.  I finished all the water in the bottle during the meal and woke up in the middle of the night to drink more.  The frisee salad was an even bigger disappointment.  It was just a gloppy mess  drenched in a sauce that was utterly flavorless.  I ate around the (drier) edges, told the waiter that it was awful, but did not ask that it be replaced.  My husband said his crepe was nothing special, but was edible, so I upped the rating.  Otherwise, I would have given the place a single star. My experience is so at variance with the consensus, that maybe it was an off-night.  Either that or I am spoiled by all the great places in my Prospect Heights/ Crown Heights nabe, where food like this would put you out of business."
1,"Hooray for Miriam in my neighb! Lovely resto, perfect for a date. The meze plates and entrees are a little small but quality over quantity am I right?? Burekas -- perfect flakiness, not too spicy either. Roasted marinated beets with green tahini -- it is cold, as beet salads tend to be. Cold and refreshing. Do not get if you're looking to warm up from the chilly outdoors (which I was). ...And I forgot which other mezes we got. They were ok. I mean they were fried. Fried stuff all tastes the same I guess. The striped bass was excellent, but a little creamy for my taste. I def plan to return to take advantage of their happy hour, which will undoubtedly be great given the intimate vibe and HUGE wine selection at Miriam. One of only a few gripes about this place was that on the night I visited there were a few puddles of water at the front of the place, which I guess got tracked and made several wet-but-doesnt-look-wet-especially-not-in-super-­dim-lighting mini-puddles around the restaurant. I saw 2 people slip during my meal and even I slipped a little on my way to the ladies' room. No one did anything about it. Eeeek."
0,"I took my wife, father-in-law and brother out for unfortunately a less than par Greek dinner at Kefi.  We had a 6:30 reservation and were seated in the worst table even though there were many others available.  Only after insisting on a different table we were reluctantly moved.   I ordered the pulled rabbit with the noodles, all I could find were three bones from a rabbit and lot of red sauce.  My wife had the shrimp with orzo and feta which consisted of only four small shrimp a dash of feta.  My father-in-law had the lamb shank with orzo. He got one large bone and two table spoons of orzo in a red sauce and four bites of meat.   My brother had something the barely resembled mousaka.  You can read his comments on Yelp.  I work for a major airline and have traveled in my 35 years most of the world, and ate a lot of airline food. When passengers complain to me next time how bad airline food is, I will say you never had bad food until you've eaten at Kefi! OPA!"
0,"A decent place to get lunch. I met a friend here who was visiting the city and found it on yelp. Luckily we beat the 12:30 rush so were seated rather quickly. The service was average, the food and atmosphere average as well. There are just so many great places in the east village I won't come here again."
0,Cafe Himalaya is BYOB no corking fee. Entree are around 8 dollars. Try to Momo and soups. They also have vegetarian options.
0,"Se gosta de culinária italiana, comer bem e beber bem este é o seu lugar em NY! O imenso espaço é dividido em diversos tipos de áreas de acordo com os pratos (petiscos, frutos do mar, carne e, obviamente, massa). É difícil escolher em qual sentar, pois todos são mais do que convidativos. Além de possuir os ambientes para comer, o lugar é um imenso mercado de produtos italianos da melhor qualidade possível. Tenho certeza de que um dia é pouco para este lugar! Vale a pena tomar um vinho e pedir uma tábua de frios no ambiente de petiscos enquanto espera a mesa em um dos restaurantes. O atendimento é excelente e os preços justíssimos."
0,Ear inn was great to stop by for drinks after dinner around the corner. A true landmark in this hood.
0,"If you haven't been to Clinton street bakery yet, youve missed out on some phenomenal pancakes. But beware!! You will be waiting at least an hour and a half, depending on the day and time you decide to swing by the restaurant. If you can, check into the restaurant so you can get your name on the waiting list, go do whatever else you need to do, and then return back. If you time it just right, you won't need to wait too long to be seated. Ok, onto the food itself! If you read the other reviewers, all you read about are the pancakes and it is no joke! It is definitely worth it! My review is more about the eggs Benedict. The dish was elegantly Prepared, even after we told them to rush the order because of a time constraint I had on my part. They still took the time to make it look just right, so it earned some points with me. The hollandaise sauce was a little salty to my taste but the biscuit and ham cancelled that out real quick. It was a nice balance of sweet and salty. Overall, no complaints from my end. As for my girlfriend, she had the plain pancakes with the maple butter and she still gives it five stars each time she has it! Food wise, it is five stars all the way, but the only complaint would be the wait time. I signed up on the list and waited almost two hours before I got seated. I had to keep checking up on the guy with the list to make sure we didn't get bumped down accidentally. Each time I asked, the wait time got extended another 20 minutes. So once you sign up on the list, let them know you will be waiting outside. :-)"
0,I can't say much about Grimaldi's that hasn't already been said. I finally tried it after being a native New Yorker for most of my life. I guess I stayed away because it was known as a tourist destination. But a friend was in town and I agreed to trek out there. I have to say that the trek was part of the fun. We took the subway and then walked the rest of the toward the water. Yes there was a line and we waited close to an hour at 3pm in the afternoon but we eventually made it iside and the pizza really did live up to the hype. Simply delicious and loved the thin crust.   After the meal we walked back to Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge to work off the calories. It's a nice afternoon thing to do on a leisure day and I'd recommend it to anyone.
0,"I came here late on a Saturday night and it was packed. We hedged our bets by putting our name down and waiting in the take-out line. About a half hour later (and really it wasn't a long line, but takeout service so painfully slow), we were seated. I had the daily special -- chili meatballs with black beans. I got in on whole wheat with tomato sauce (one option out of several). The sandwich was well prepared. But overall I found it rather bland. And for a place so demanding -- of your time and patience -- it was even more unsatisfying."
1,"I love little places like this hidden away in Brooklyn!! The atmosphere was dim, and somewhat romantic :) The server was patient, and actually spoke Italian!! It was so wonderful to hear the language among the staff and customers!! The food was delicious and just enough. Unending bread basket, and a small dish of olives are complimentary. We started off with a gorgonzola and walnut salad, and the black olive gnocchi with red sauce was incredibly savory and smooth. The tiramisu was a bit too rich, but the menu was full of wonderful choices!! I would, without a doubt return. Come early (7pm) it will be crowded by 8."
1,"you can't go to ny w/o eating pizza.  everytime i go, i want to try a new place.  i had heard good things about lucali, so we made the trek to brooklyn.  we called ahead to see how long the wait would be for 3 people on a fri night, and they said they would put our name down while we made our way.  when we got off the subway, our table was ready, so we booked it to the restaurant. there is a velvet rope outside the door, which made me laugh.  we got a corner table in the small and rustic restaurant.  they only have pizza (one size) and calzone, and 3 of us shared the pizza.  we added mushrooms, basil, garlic and shallots, and my pepperoni-eating fried got a huge plate of it on the side.  it was the perfect amount for 3 so that you can leave room for dessert. byob!"
0,"Nice place to eat. very different food and have alot of choice for the holidays, party or just business lunch. Im happy that i can come back when i have free time."
0,"Post office is one of the hidden Gems in Williamsburg nightlife - one of the newer and better, for sure.  Located off the beaten track in South Williamsburg, just off of the BQE on Havemeyer, Post Office boasts an outstanding array of whisky and gin concoctions (more liquor mixes available, if you ask) that'll have you raving to your friends for nights to come.  Generally speaking, their liquor offerings are enough to win them bragging rights amongst their compatriots. Jeff, one of the bartenders, has an excellent knowledge of each cocktail; he was able to recommend a cocktail to suit each of my changing moods thoughout the night (yes, my moods change throughout the night... apparently).  If in the mood for something sweet, I recommend Post Office's ""Benediction"", which Jeff made for me without my asking. Basically, just go - enjoy yourself, the food, the cocktails, the Americana decor.  I highly recommend it.  They're right around the corner from Traif, and present an excellent cap to one's night in Williamsburg."
1,"I love love love Bodhi Tree for their prix fixe lunch specials! You cannot beat it - under a tenner for app, entree, and drink! Their portions are very generous and the food very flavorful. I've been here a handful of times, from catchups with friends to birthday lunches - even my graduation lunch! The decor is also very elegant & appropriate for a Thai restaurant. What they lack in restaurant size they make up for in their ambiance & food! I'd choose Bodhi over Cafetasia anyday ;)"
1,"it's quiet, small, affordable and has good sandwiches.  Also, you can order breakfast anytime!"
1,Impossibly thin and explosively delicious. Best pizza I've had to date. I highly recommend the tie dye pizza !
0,"Definitely do not go here if you have food allergies. The staff is not knowledgable and will tell you things are safe when they are NOT. I called ahead, explained I would happily order whatever was safe, and was told on the phone and in person when I double-checked that the veggie burger and bug were dairy-free. I tried a bite and quickly peeled off the bread. I became very ill that night (diarrhea! Panic attack! Vomiting!)and called to tell them in the morning, convinced that the person I had dealt with didn't know better, and was greeted with indifference. ""The bun has cream and butter in it."" Yes, I know that now. If I hadn't been told explicitly, twice, that it was safe for me, I would not have touched it. I will NEVER go here again, which is a shame because I did like that atmosphere, and the drinks were decent. I see no way I can trust this place anymore. Food allergies are not jokes. You could get sued until there is no restaurant, or you could actually kill someone."
1,I think the steak is a better choice than my chorizo tacos - where's the chorizo? It's mostly potatoes
1,"We were fortunate enough to have the Scratchbread stuffing (made from their own mix!) at our Thanksgiving. Apparently their scones are fantastic, too, but I haven't yet tried them. Highly recommended!"
1,The appetizers are great. Good service n the Briyani not up to the mark.
1,So good. I never have been a fan of combining savory and sweet but the salted caramel fingers are ridiculous.
1,New York's best fine dining establishment.
1,"4-1/2 stars! Whoa, what great pasta!   Start with the chicken liver and the croquettes.  I found the braised short rib to be a little tasteless, but I'm tough on short ribs (-1/2 a star). Oh, and the wines by the glass were wonderful. This is my new go to for italian,.  I'm not wasting my time with Bianca anymore!!"
1,"This place saved me in a moment of need and I will not forget it. If there was ever a morning I needed to order a breakfast sandwich through a window, this was it. The cook doesn't say a word but he's a wunderkind with bacon, their buns -- fluffy like a cloud, and the coffee is tall dark and handsome.   My favorite part is that you don't have to walk into an actual restaurant or store to get your grub. I'm not sure if it's proper but I just order from the window and loiter until it's ready. Yum!"
1,"Overpriced coffee, overpriced hot chocolate, overpriced everything. This place is strictly for rich and wealthy folk, or for the European visitors that dont know any better. I don't see the big fuss about the place, but I don't fit the adjectives listed earlier. $6 for a hot chocolate... 'nuff said. Eli's is around the corner from this place, and Marche Madison is a block away. Spend your money in either of those places."
1,Overpriced and overhyped. Good apps but the chicken dish was cooked so close to pink that I could barely eat it.  Too busy in there to bother having them re-cook it.  Bummer since we were excited to eat there.
1,Thank god for no wait on a Friday at 11am!! Waltz right in and got our goodness. Does more need to be said?
1,"The place is very nice, really welcoming. The food is cheap and simple, more on the cafe'-side than a real restaurant. I tried the cous-cous and it was very good."
0,"You are human beings none the less. As far as one can see.  Of the same species as myself.  Of the same species as Pozzo! Made in God's image!  I remember the maps of the Holy Land. Coloured they were. Very pretty. The Dead Sea was pale blue. The very look of it made me thirsty. That's where we'll go, I used to say, that's where we'll go for our honeymoon. We'll swim. We'll eat Baby Jesus cake. We'll be happy. Nothing to be done."
0,Burgers and Men.  What more could a girl want?   Hooray... best time ever
0,"We picked up a pizza this past weekend while staying near by. Let me tell you this is the worst pizza I have had in a long time.  I would expect far better pizza from any place in NYC.  The cheese was oily and salty.  It was a disgusting gloppy mess.  We had FAR better pizza down the street, and I wish I tried some other place.  Only go here if you cannot walk another block and are desperate for something other than McDonalds.  This place was a huge let down.  GROSS!!"
0,"I thought I would love this place I had high hopes. It looked pretty interesting online.  First turn off was the the pricing for their products. Its  just not feasible or economical. After purchasing their misco kale salad, I had a bad stomach ache soon after which lasted for weeks. I never had stomach issues so it was a shock. I found out soon after from visiting my primary doctor that I had contracted a parasite and I blame them. I have no proof it was them but I know my body and what I ate that day and the weeks in between. I will not be returning. They are obviously brand new to the food industry and have a whole lot of work to do. Unfortunately my pockets don't deserve to be sacrificed while they figure it out.  Sometimes looks can be deceiving, i thought it was getting back to the way humans ate? Its more so  over hyped with prices even Steve Jobs God rest his soul would scoff at. Its far too expensive.  The prices are outrageous, enter at your own risk. I'll pass. I 'd rather go to whole foods cheaper and safer."
0,"wow. came in again for for dinner and had such an amazing time! as we opened the door i just knew i was gonna have a great time. great soundtrack, amazing food, and the warmest service. i had the burger with haloumi  cheese, the waitress recommended - and was quite delicious and my husband had the whole fish (dorade i think) with couscous - it was just like somewhere on the Mediterranean sea... will be back soon Jacks wife!"
0,"Excellent! HUGE RIDICULOUS LINE outside at sub-zero temperatures, but the 2 hour wait was worth it. Maybe it was because i'm hungry but i'm definitely coming back."
0,Decent food and vibe. Service wasn't that great hence the 3 stars. Might try again
1,The food was really good!! I really liked the yams and mac and cheese!! The service was great! Our waitress was awesome!!
1,"Can you say BEST LATE NIGHT SNACK EVER?? This place is awesome simply because its: 1) they sell french fries- who doesn't love them?? 2) they have more than 30 different sauces for these fries. The mango chutney one is SO GOOD. 3) it's in st marks place- good location. 4) has a strangely good ambiance/feeling when you walk in here. Be ready to wait on a long line that extends out the door, especially on late nights."
0,"Trendy spot with good but not outstanding American dishes. I'd definitely come here again though. The atmosphere is lively and fun. It's a nice place to stop by with a small group for some conversation and standard American cuisine with an occasional vegan twist for some menu choices. For example, although not vegan, I enjoyed a large juicy burger made from free-range beef raised on a vegetarian diet, and you could certainly taste the difference. Obvious cons: service was a tad mediocre (waitress never seemed to be near and the food took too long), the place can get uncomfortably crowded, and some dishes are just, well, okay. But the pros do outweigh the cons, so I'll be back."
1,"I went here today with some coworkers for lunch... really good! I got the Mexican falafel sandwich, and the pesto was fantastic. I also thought that it was really a lot of - high quality - food. I was there at around 2, so it was past the lunch rush, but it still seemed pretty crowded. I'm not sure I'd want to venture there an hour earlier. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a little overpriced, and they put tomato on my falafel after I asked for no tomato because I'm allergic."
1,"HOLY EFF! could this be my new favorite barbeque place in the city?? SO. SO. GOOD! do come here. do get the spare ribs. do get the brisket. but seriously, DO GET THE SPARE RIBS! $8 for 2 giant, ridiculously tasty, meat falling of the bone ribs. all their sides are delicious and your meats come with slaw, pickled onions, and pickles. everything is good here. buffet style (buy by poundage) in a casual, east-villagey environment. getting a table is a wait-til-someone-is-done-and-jump-in-their-seat-­before-someone-else-steals-it kind of situation which is never fun but people are constantly moving so its not too bad."
1,Expensive but good!  Super small space!  Be prepared to eat and talk right next to everyone else.  Super small!  Wait staff is fabulous (at least our server was)!  Bring your wallet.
