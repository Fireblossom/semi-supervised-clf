1,"I give this place a hearty ehhhh My tacos were underwhelming, the beans were flavorless and the rice was undercooked. The guy behind the counter couldn't have been less interested. All in all, It had a very fast food feel, very disappointing."
0,"I was made to feel less than and discriminated against. Having been there 3 times prior, I walked in like before but was told they were seating ""only reservations"", at 10:30pm, even after I offered to wait for a table, they said ""we're fully committed and you can return tomorrow"". So i decided to call, 10 minutes later pretending to inquire about the wait time for a table and was told it would be a 25 minutes. Whether it was cause I'm brown skinned, was dressed down, if I were gay or any reason they could find...DISCRIMINATION IS DISCRIMINATION and its wrong."
0,"This is my favorite spot for Thai food.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is flavorful.  The portions are large too.  The place is loud on a Saturday night but all other times it's fine.  There's also outdoor seating in the back.  The only reason it's getting four starts out of five is because the wine selection is ok, not great, but other than that this place is a jewel.  Order the curry when you go!"
1,This is my favorite place in the neighborhood and maybe even the city. Everything is good here. It's simple. It's inexpensive. It's fresh. It's delicious. I order weekly from this place.
1,"Probably my favorite bar in Brooklyn. I've been going to this bar since it opened and the beers have only gotten better. The atmosphere is great and the people are super nice. When they first open they didn't have food, but once they did, the food is amazing. I would recommend the Burger or the BLT if they have it."
1,"This isn't related to food but manner; we're locals, my wife & I dropped by at 10pm, place was still crowded, but bar was empty, asked to sit for one drink, and they wouldn't seat us. Which is fine if you think it important to adhere strictly to your rules but an unfortunate decision for a new opening."
1,"Been there today, Friday, about 7pm - not very busy, about 10 people. However, for this small space (just about the size of my bathroom really), that's A LOT. But service was quick and friendly. Dumplings were good, not OMIGOD GIMME MORE good, but good to the point of ""how about another portion"". We tried pork-and-chive (fried, a bit too spicy for me) and pork-and-cabbage (boiled, very nice). Not a fan of sesame pancake with Peking duck - too oily, too much pancake, too little duck (there, I said it, fans of the pancake, please don't kill me now) - but for $1.75 it's a miracle you get any duck at all =) All in all, I'd certainly visit if I were in the area, or if I was hungry and only had a buck."
0,"WOW!!! Fantastic place! Great vibe and delicious, delicious, delicious food!!!  The fried chicken and waffles rock!!! Best Soul food on the planet!  Friendly service."
0,"We had dinner at L'Artusi for our anniversary and had a wonderful evening. Our waiter was attentive, and the food was fabulous!  The roasted mushrooms were our favorite dish of the evening, although the torte with salted caramel ice cream was a close second. We come to NYC every year for our anniversary and always pick new restaurants, but L'Artusi made such an impression we are doing a repeat performance next year! Sit upstairs if you want a more quiet atmosphere, as we did."
1,"This is a very unassuming little Brazilian restaurant with a lot to offer! From the outside, it seems like nothing more than another cafe, but the inside is surprisingly lovely! It has a small business charm, with attentive service to match. The food was delicious. While the menu seems pricey, when you receive your food and taste how delicious their quality ingredients are, you realize this is a good deal. They have a very interesting drinks menu, and is definitely worth trying their creations."
0,Shake burgers are the best!!!! I still like in and out better though.
1,"here's the shortlist: garden seating is best, especially on a warm summer night- although the indoor seating is really... cute (for a lack of better words). cheeseburger + fries = pretty great mussels = pretty average (get something else, mussel-lovers!) no refill on soft drinks (they bring it out in glass bottles) not the fastest service, but the garden is so nice to talk in! they take card, yay!"
0,"Came here for lunch after our tour of soho, little Italy, and Chinatown. It's a nice big restaurant, so it was nice to not have to wait. Service was fast and efficient. We ordered a large margarita pizza with sweet Italian sausage. I loved the fresh mozzarella slices and the nice crispy thin crust. Basil was fresh and definitely made all the ingredients come together. It was $30 for a large pizza with one meat topping, which is a decent deal, but It didn't fill us all up"
0,Great Food! Great Service! Great Atmosphere!  GREAT TIME !!!!! Special Thanks to Chef Eric
1,"My friend came up from Baltimore for a 24 hour visit. Our plan was to stop at Eataly for lunch before walking around the city. Well, our stop turned into FIVE hours. Seriously. We began at the vegetarian station (roasted root salad), then headed to the seafood station (steamed seafood salad), then pasta station (butternut squash and pumpkin lasagna), then ended at the piazza. In between, we explored the market, chatted with our waitresses, looked through cookbooks, made some purchases... Five hours, four stations, seven glasses of wine (between the two of us). A PERFECT day."
1,"We came Wednesday night, four ppl. Two of us ordered shabu-shabu, I had beef bibimbap. My bibimbap was surprisingly good, better than those served in Korean town. The portion was great and meat was in good quality. Dipping and sauce are just right. I will come back this place for its rice dishes and also probably gonna try their noodle dishes, too."
1,The first time I went to Soco I was underwhelmed. I was totally disappointed with the food. I'm not even sure why I returned. But I'm glad I did!!! Soco redeemed themselves in every way! The food and drinks were fantastic. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of Mac and cheese. The food came out piping hot and fresh. The first time around the chicken was bland. Not this time. The chicken was very tasty without being too salty. The waffles were fluffy and tasted better than ordinary Eggo waffles but not as sweet as a piece of red velvet cake. They were perfect this time around! The mac n cheese is a little pricey for a side ($9) but it was soooo worth it! And the portion is big enough to share. My cocktail of the night was the peach cobbler. I wanted another but I was afraid I wouldn't finish my food! It was really good. I'm so happy Soco stepped their game up. Can't wait to return!
1,Love this place - beautiful atmosphere & amazing drinks ... Brunch is crazy delicious!!!
1,"I'm a huge seafood eater, so of course at Lupa I skimmed directly to the fish portion of the menu. I ended up getting the trout with fennel and fava gremolata. It was good, but I've had better trout before. Maybe I should have looked over the pasta before I made my choice, but oh well. There's always next time!"
1,"Things I've had here that were good: trick question. The answer is ""nothing,"" because everything I've had here is ridiculously amazingly great - the service, the oysters, the zero times I've had to wait, the cocktails, the ridiculous vegetable specials, the atmosphere, the brick chicken & whole porgy, the sultry/hungry glances I exchange with my boyfriend, the scale in the bathroom that is so obviously miscalibrated and cuts 5 pounds off my weight... (It's the kind of place you can take your boyfriend but also your mom, which is a mark of particular brilliance in my mind)"
0,"I am fairly sure this is the same as Cafe Zaiya. It perplexes me how fast a storefront changes hand. Well... welcome to New York I guess? The food is solid. According to my Jap friends, the buns are fairly authentic, with red bean flavors, pinaple crispy tops etc I also enjoyed the black sesame frappe! Sorry starbucks, you are just not NEAR creative as this one"
1,"It's good food but it's def not worth the LONG line and the 45 MINUTE wait if you don't get there before/after the rush! There are plenty of other Halal carts in the city that are just as good that have no line at all. Overview: If not a long line, go for it. If there is, find another one of the million Halal carts in the city!"
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would but that's not an option. The staff was so clueless they couldn't find a spoon in the god damn restaurant. Please protect yourselves from this shithole. There was no foam on the cappucino they couldn't tell coffee from the water sitting on the table next to me. Bloomberg should be ashamed this dump resides in his city.
1,"I think to-go-ing my pommes frites gives me a bigger portion, or is this all in my head? They packaged the pommes frites with two cones, which was perfect because i could split it to other people. They provide a LOT of yummy sauces to sample and try, while they do have complimentary sauces too. I ordered the mango chutney, and the belgium mayo sauce. the second night i was here i got the especial (onion, ketchup, mayo)-free, Curry ketchup, Vietnamese pineapple, & Mango chutney basically the mango chutney is the best hands down. its a lil spicy, but sooooo darn good. the consistency is perfect for dipping with fries the vietnamese pineapple sauce had a weird spice in it that i still don't get it, but it is sweet i like the especial because its normally what i like to eat with my hotdogs and fries. curry ketchup wasn't my favorite at all, there was too much kick from the curry. I would go here day after day if I was living in NY ..."
1,"Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I sat by the window and was excited to note the Michelin recommended sticker. Breakfast was still available and I went back and forth between that and the spinach enchiladas. I chose the later. They were really flavorless, I was much more excited by the simple rice & beans served on the side."
1,We had a bunch of stuff. The flavors were good but it doesn't make me a chicken fan. Liked the sake lime and the other cold sake we ha a lot. Weird! I likedthe drinks more than the food.  I think I'd appreciate this food In street food scene in japan more.
1,"I have been wanting to visit Jacob's for ages. Aside from loving pickles, I love food in general, so it only seemed like a natural attraction. We whisked in on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Despite the horrid and wet weather, it was tres crowded. We were quickly seated. The menu, how divine. Things served in biscuits, pickles beyond belief. We got the sweet and spicy pickled carrots. Slightly tender, amazingly delicious. These are a must try. The lemonade was sweet beyond belief. If you're a diabetic, this'll be the last thing you ever drink. The food -- heavenly. I got the biscuits, gravy and eggs (with sausage gravy). The eggs made this dish SO RICH. Next time, I'll skip the eggs because the gravy definitely did well on it's own. Or maybe I'll just ask for one egg? Two was definitely overkill. Rus got the bacon fried chicken with pancakes? The chicken was battered in something really delicious tasting. This meal was simply perfect. A match made in heaven, that's me and Jacob's Pickles. Sigh."
1,"This place is insane! Try to get here early because after 7 it starts to get hectic and i've seen people get turned away after hearing it may take 45minutes just to get seated. The menu changes all the time and most of the items are excellent. If there is scallops on the menu I HIGHLY recommend you try them. They are thick, juicy, and not over done. The flavor is just amazing as well. My girlfriend loves the spicy tuna tartare there as well. A must try is probably the bacon donuts. You would never think they work that well but bacon donuts with come coffee ice cream taste great! We go back whenever we crave an amazing meal!"
1,I love brunch.  whenever someone asks me to get bunch I hug them and offer to pay for their bunch.  I love brunch so much that I only eat brunch.  this place has great brunch.  full bar.
0,"The service of the sitting staff is just appalling.  That is even before ordering any food, do you expect any tips with just plain rude attitude."
0,My favorite places for GOOD Pizza!!!!!
0,Just ate at a great fast food restaurant in the Chelsea area that opened this week to raves from all the customers I sat next to.  I'm very impressed with their congenial staff and delicious reasonably priced food.  I highly recommend this unique eating experience and can only say if in its first week the lines were out the door this place is a homerun.  Can't wait to come back for lunch.
0,The best!!!
0,"Took me 4 trips to this place to finally be able to get a slice. First time: closed Second time: closed because of extreme weather(with what he charges  for his pizza, you would think the place would have an A/C 3rd time: closed because they ran out of dough(never heard anything so ridiculous before) 4th time: woohoooo! Finally I got a slice, and the moment I took the first bite I couldn't help but laugh and think about that famous PT Barnum quote. The pizza was garbage. Burnt, well, actually, more like charred, tasteless and just not worth even a penny. Do yourself a favor, and go to John's on  Bleeker, or any decent pizzeria in Brooklyn(every neighborhood has at least half a dozen of them) and stay away from this shithole."
0,"IF YOU ARE A SELF RESPECTING WOMAN WHO IS LOOKING TO EAT SOME DELICIOUS FOOD OR RESERVE A TABLE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY LOOK ELSEWHERE PLEASE!!!!!! I made a reservation for a birthday dinner several days before the actual day. They only offered me two different times that were way apart. And by this I mean the interval was ridiculous. Something like 6:45 or 11:30. I opted for the earlier one, even though my friends worked until 7 and could not get there on time. Upon arriving, I took a seat at the bar and was kindly offered a cocktail by the AMAZINGLY helpful and welcoming bartenders. They had taken my card and put it on file to reserve the table, and told me my table would be mine for two hours. While I waited for my friends to arrive at the bar, the MANAGER came up to me and told me I was gorgeous, but he would need to personally take in my dress (since it was a flowing, shirt dress with no belt) because my ""dress did not do justice"". When I exclaimed, ""EXCUSE ME?!"" he proceeded to add that I needed to show more leg and my figure because the dress was unflattering. HE CLEARLY HAD A RING ON HIS FINGER AND IS A MARRIED MAN. When my friend interjected and made him know we saw his ring, he simply shrugged and told her she was mad because he didn't flirt with her. :0 Once my friends arrived at about 7:30, I went up to the maitre d and informed him. He looked at me and told me he sat down others in MY TABLE, WHICH WAS RESERVED FOR 2 HOURS. He then continued to add that walk-ins take precedence, which completely baffles me because, JEEZ what is then the point of making a reservation?! IT IS MEANT TO RESERVE A SPOT FOR AN ALLOTTED PERIOD OF TIME. Unfortunately these two massively uncomfortable instances were enough to ruin my perception of the restaurant. The drinks were delicious. The food was as well. But POOR POOR POOR POOR POOR and PUTRID SERVICE. I AM DISGUSTED. The owner would do well in firing their entire management staff. Like I said the food was good, but the quantity was a joke, as well as the pricing for such menial meals. The most surprising thing out of all of this was after I expressed my annoyance I was not even offered an apology. Simple. I will never return again. If you appreciate honesty at its best, you'd believe this review for all its worth, because I give credit where it's due."
0,Great food.
1,Their Washu Gyu Hamburg is incredibly delicious with the sauce. What I recommend so far are 1. Washu-Gyu Hamburg 2. Chicken Nanban 3. Harami Aburi (not sure the name) They are still BYOB open. I cannot wait for full open. I need to cover their whole mune. Thanks to Yudai who is the BOSS!!
1,"Grilled Corn FTW - covered in delicious spices, cheese and other awesome ingredients.  We were pleasantly surprised to get 2 cobs per order.  Perfect for sharing! Roast Pork FTW - A very hearty meal.  Roast pork was very tender... similar to a plate full of carnitas? Cuban Sandwich FTW - Perfect for those roast pork lovers who don't like the beans and want some fries The long long wait FTL - This place is super small.  Expect to wait, even if you get there at 9pm."
0,"I just ate here last friday and I love the place. Here are the reason why: 1. VERY ACCOMMODATING WAITERS - They allowed me to sit in a table of six even if my friends arrived 15mins after. Some restaurants don't let you sit unless you're a complete party. But this restau made me sit even if I was waiting for 5 more people to come. I say this is an important thing. 2. GREAT FOOD. - As a Filipino, I would really know which Filipino food is legit and which are not. The food here is pretty legit! Dinuguan was great! Sisig was great! Pork adobo was great. Tinola was okay. Ginataang Sitaw and Kalabasa was amazing. Halo-halo and Buko Pandan was comparable to the ones in Manila. And the ube ice cream was very good! All of which MUST be accompanied by Red Horse Beer. 3. FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT - With Filipinos around, you're sure to see smiling and friendly people. My friends who are non-Filipinos love the place not only because of the food but because the store owners would check up on us, converse with us, and even crack jokes on us. Very relaxing environment. I felt at home."
1,"Dined with 9 other people on 6/23/2010.  We had reservations, thankfully, or we probably wouldn't have been able to find enough seating.  The barstaff really knows their stuff and it's quite entertaining just to watch them crank out cocktails, but they're not all winners - the Manhattan was better than the Mint Julep, which was better than the Sazerac.  Crispy string beans were delicious, the lamb merguez was tasty but a meager portion, red snapper over corn & fennel was perfectly cooked.  The burgers looked juicy and everyone who ordered one was content.  The lobster roll was rather small (for $24!) but tasted excellent.  Everything's overpriced, but the service is on point.  I had an enjoyable meal here, but probably will not return on account of the exorbitant prices."
1,"This place was great.  The food was fantastic.  Even though the place was packed and there was a wait for tables, I loved that our waitress didn't rush us at all.   We had a very leisurely dinner and our waitress was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.   The decor is adorable.  There appeared to be a back room and maybe a garden, but I never made it back there.  Maybe next trip."
0,"Hole in the wall of a place, but the line moves quickly and the staff are nice.  Huge slices, though not your typical ""NY style"". Artichoke pizza itself gets 5 stars. All others get 3 or less (depending)."
1,Seafood tasted really fresh! It's inexpensive considering the quality of seafood you get. Everyone must try the stuffed clams with crab meat.
1,"I will acknowledge from the get go that I am not the biggest fans of Korean food as I can't get over cold noodles, but this place was one of the worst Korean places I have had in NYC. The staff were not really attentive....I had to ask four times for my water to be filled up. The seafood pancake was soggy as opposed to crispy and the steamed dumplings lacked flavor. The grilled beef was ok, but I can make a better version at home and I am not really a chef. My wife loves Korean food and agreed that this place left something to be desired. We came at 1 am after the us open so were looking for a place that was open, but next time, we will do more research and go to a better place."
1,delicious. thats why theres always a line at 2am.
0,I love it! So many times i did not know what to order for lunch and this place is on top of my list ALWAYS! I stick to the Chicken Sandwich  and it's so tasty! Everyone i introduce it to loves it as well.
0,"The music was outstanding -- 80s French pop.   All the staff spoke French with one another. The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious, although the staff was attentive and helpful. The food was rich, but not heavy, and served in large portions. We will be back."
0,"To me it is best place to try real American burger and Steak! You will be melting while eating.. It is a promise! I  just dont like the way they help you in the entrance. The receptionist says they put you on a waiting list but They dont even take your phone number. You either come back after 1,5 - 2hrs later or wait ourside or hang out at the bar area. And you have to ask and remind that person several times that you are waiting for the t - it seems tt need more efficient system.. So what I recommend especially when they are packed on Fridays and Saturdays just skip this guy in the front and hang out at the bar, as soon as you have a bar chair order your food-otehrwise you will wait 2 hrs maybe more to be able to order!"
1,"Didn't know what to expect because it was all vegan but it was delicious. Had the mango roll and the wrap with the mushrooms inside. The roll was good but the mushroom wrap was not to my liking. It had peanut butter inside which I normally like peanut butter but not so much on a wrap. Also it was hard to bite down into it without making a complete mess. Definitely not first date food, the wrap at least. Also had watermelon mint juice which was nice."
0,"Very good hot pot restaurant.  So far away, be hungry when going here with many people. Squid can be eaten raw, you should try, it is fun.  They play Korean music in the back and it makes me happy."
1,"Ilili was fabulous! Being a vegetarian, I was thrilled to see the number of veegtarian appetizer and entree options available. The fries were delicious as was the gnocchi and the hummus. The quality of the food was very high, and the ambience was trendy and classy at the same time. The service was impeccable. Being fairly reasonably priced, Ilili is a great restaurant for groups of almost any size and is a must-try for any Lebanese food fan."
0,"Sandwiches, Coffee and Pastries OH MY! This cafe rocks I am a food-a-holic and Iris satisfies multiple food cravings of mine. Great service very professional and fast."
1,"I've been told that there are places out here that serve awesome pizza without the long wait. But I still had to visit Grimaldi's because it's Grimaldi's. The wait outside was about 45min. They let us cut to the front since we were a party of two and okay to sit at the bar. The wait after ordering was another 30min. We were so hungry, the two of us split a large (3-4 people) and killed it. Water never got refilled. The host made me laugh though because he reached for my bicep and asked if I work out. What's this I hear about artichoke pizza though?"
0,"We went there for brunch, and I was not impressed. I like that they have a great brunch deal.  For food, cocktail, coffee/tea and OJ, it's $15. However, you have to specifically ask for all the drinks. Because stuff did not bring OJ and did not even ask us if we wanted them, we ended up not getting them. Also, I dishes were very salty. I still think it is one of the places to go for cheap brunch, but this place is not the best in the city."
1,Hands down the best spanish in the city...Patatas bravas...did not find one place in spain that made them as good...! The Pinxos Morunos also...amazing and so flavorful we ordered another serving..
0,"It is not a huge restaurant, nor do you feel as if you are sitting on the laps of the other diners around you. The food...excellent! The staff, very friendly. Location. Very convenient. Take the N or Q train towards Queens to Broadway. Walk to the street level and a there you are! My favorite dish? The shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. Delicious!!"
1,"is this place worth all the hype and the stars? DUH the pizza was thin, the crust was great, and the topics were delicious...except that spinach, skip it, makes the pizza too moist, unless you like soggy pizza but dang, this place is expensive, 16 bucks for a pizza with no toppings, and $3 per topping (or $2/topping for half the pizza only) 40 bucks on pizza...i can justify that, i hope"
0,"Great service, friendly staff, and amazing food. 5 stars for this restaurant for sure."
1,"The food gets a 3 and the atmosphere rounds it up to 4 stars. We ate here on last Saturday night for the first time, having heard from a trusted source that this place was a must-try.  The food reminds me of Da Andrea, another close-by, relatively cheap but consistently good Italian ""neighborhood"" place.  The thing that Malatesta brings to the table (over Da Andrea) is its quite charming and festive farmhouse style atmosphere (though the food at Da Andrea is a bit more varied and better, I think).  The host and hostess were extremely accomodating and pleasant (bringing chairs to us on the sidewalk while we waited, letting us have a 4-top for two - to sit down early- as long as we could be through by the time of the next reservation, etc. etc.).  We got a 1/2 carafe of house Chianti for $17, the mixed grilled vegetable salad, the (huge) chicken cutlet and the (mountain of) home made gnocchi with tomato and basil sauce.  The food was satisfying and the portions were plentiful, in case you hadn't gotten that yet.  Everything was very reasonably priced-- entrees in the $12 to $15 range.  Oh, and I have seen others comment on the complimentary bread- it is delicious.  It is flavored with a bit of oil, and even vinegar, it seemed, and was quite zesty- so much so that we preferred it without adding any oil or balsmic to the bread plate. Very cozy and inviting-- very charming.  Seems especially suited for date night or girls night out.  Just remember- cash only."
0,"My family and I just had thanksgiving dinner at Cheryl's and it was excellent! We are from New Orleans so it's hard to beat our southern cuisine. we decided this year that we didn't want to do all the work. This place did not disappoint. If you are looking for great food in Brooklyn, check it out.  I see some reviews say a Cheryl the owner is not as warm and friendly as some would like. well maybe, she is busy making that kick ass Mac n cheese or her delicious salmon. I will be going back and recommending to friends."
1,The Bah Kut Teh here is as good as my mom makes it back in Singapore. 5 out of 5!
1,"NYC FOODAPOLOOZA STOP #1 the name says it all...aside from the uncomfortably small quarters, this was much needed and pretty tasty, as the name implies. the noodles were delicious and cooked perfectly. the broth was light, but flavorful."

0,So yummy and fresh!
1,"In short, the food shined, the service was lacking. Ambiance: rustic and warm. This isn't one of those restaurants that people went to see and be seen, despite all the publicity. The dining felt intimate, and would be an equally great spot to catch up with friends or bring a date. Service: This was my main qualm. I was almost going to give it three stars because while the service was polite, it was far from what you would expect to receive at a top restaurant. The server came over exactly three times- once to take the drinks order, dinner order and to bring us the check. He didn't come over once to ask us how the food was or if we needed anything additional. Left a very bad taste in my mouth indeed. However, the supporting staff didn't miss a beat which was somewhat redeeming- water glasses were kept full, the table wiped clean, silver wear changed between courses. In short, don't come here looking for spectacular service. I noticed a family enjoying their meal besides us and clearly the matriarch was displeased with her duck course. Said absentee server had to be flagged down to bring the plate back to the kitchen and in my estimation should have returned to ask how she was enjoying the pork entree replacement. He didn't. She wasn't smiling. I doubt he received a good tip. Onto the main event- the food. I had the following dishes: Sheep's' Milk Ricotta with sea salt and herbs- meant to be enjoyed as a crostini. The bread was sliced thin, perfectly crisp and seasoned with crushed pepper- big fan. The ricotta itself was smooth and creamy, yet light in texture. Served with olive oil and herbs. I thought the dish was successful but felt that the serving size was almost too large (probably better for a table of 4 rather than 2). Ideally a dish leaves you wanting more (lick the plate good) but there is only so much ricotta you can eat at one time. Between two ladies, half of the dish was untouched. I would also comment that I felt that the seasoning was on the light side. The creaminess of the cheese could have been better punctuated by slightly more salt at the very least and the herbs were barely noticeable (I tried to dissect what the component herbs were but failed). Blue Crab with jalapeños and tomato- Absolutely DELICIOUS. I would return and order to servings of this crostini. An amazing play of textures. Crab was served warm (pleasant surprise) and lightly seasoned so that the flavor and texture shone, accented by thin slices of cucumber and jalapeno. I was expecting the jalapeno to overpower the delicate texture and flavor crab but it was an excellent complement- lending a coolness and crunch along with the ""bite"" of the pepper. I was literally savoring each bite, it was absolute heaven. Easily the highlight of the meal. Penne Rigate with lamb bolognese, ricotta and mint- I wasn't impressed with my pasta course in terms of texture and flavor. It was very ordinary and doesn't compare to Scarpetta or Convivio, although the price point was about $10 less. First observation is that the pasta wasn't cooked exactly al dente, which is a huge fail right there. The lamb bolognese wasn't as ""meaty"" or hearty as I would expect for a lamb based bolognese. The tomato sauce didn't fare much better in my estimation- acidity was on point but lacked depth. A dollop of sheep's milk ricotta was meant to cut into the acidity of the sauce but it felt like a random afterthought. If anything, it felt like there were too many ""lamb/sheep"" components in the mix. However, I did enjoy the mint in the dish- initial thought was that it had a somewhat Moroccan flavor profile, and it did help draw out the flavor of the lamb. In general would stay away from the pasta from what I experienced. Special- Halibut with roasted artichokes and fingerling potatoes- The fish was perfectly cooked, flaky and moist, and the right sear to the top. Complemented with a pickled relish crust which I couldn't quite figure out. Not sure what was used as the base for the relish- at first bite you get the sweetness and tartness of the brine, followed by an odd kick at the end. In any case it was delicious. Served with roasted artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and an olive based sauce that complemented the flavors of the fish well. Overall the dish was tasty but not exactly a highlight. Lemon Tart buttermilk gelato, limoncello granita- Had read that this was a must try. I'm a big fan of lemon tarts and gleefully report that it didn't disappoint. Hats off to Karen deMasco! The texture was smooth and velvety and the crust dense with just the right amount of salt to complement the filling which beautifully balanced the sweet and tangy profiles. For about $100 a head (two crostinis shared, pasta, secondi and dolce, 1 glass of wine and coffee), a delicious ""value."""
0,"Finally, I made it to this place today after living in NYC over 10yrs. As a Tokyo-born Japanese, unfortunately I have to say their soba was very disappointing... The soba sauce didn't have enough saltiness/sweetness at all, no flavor of Bonito/Niboshi(dried fish) either. Addition to that, my cold soba was way too cold (icy cold) which is not the right way. (Never had that cold soba/any noodle in my life) And, soba itself didn't have an aroma of buckwheat at all... Even though I was starving and was so excited to have soba that day, I couldn't finish a 2/3 of the mid-small bowl of it. I wanted to take my parents to this place whenever they visit me next time, but it seems like that's not gonna happen... ;("
1,Cynical New Yorkers say this place is just okay. But that's what they say about anything that becomes too famous. It's actually quite good and definitely worth checking out at least once.
0,Kefi... meditterranean or greek? I wasnt sure..but I wasnt impressed. The white walls and decor would've felt homey if it wasnt so overly crowded. The wait is not worth the food at all.. would rather go for authentic middle eastern food down at 53rd and 6th lol
1,"Char-Siu & Chicken over a bowl of rice. Yummy. I had to get this bowl of Cantonese style cuisine takeout for my last meal I could savor in the airport lounge before 2 weeks in Europe. 2 weeks without Asian food - this was my last meal! Simple, affordable, and a must visit again for quick food in NYC."
1,"more like *Yum Pang! The Khmer Sausage sandwich was great. I finished it before I even remembered to put on the hot sauce. Not sure how it differs from Vietnamese sandwiches because I'm pretty ignorant, but if i purely base on it that sandwich i'd say it's more saucy and char-grilled flavored. They'll have your sandwich ready super quickly too."
1,"Came here with a big group this weekend and had a great time. While there was a pretty lengthy wait for a table, the big outdoor space has cornhole, arcade games, and a bar to keep you busy. Four of us at one end of the table split the following: -fried clam strips (standard, tasty) -two orders of fries (very good, and at $3.50 an order was a cheap way to fill up) -a dozen house oysters (surprisingly good for the price, although either the mignonette or the cocktail sauce was sweeter than usual) -BK Steampot (Dungeonness, snow, king crab legs. Yummmmm -- but pricey at $42 for basically just 1-3 legs of each kind of crab) -Pitcher of Six Point Takeaway: great spot to spend time with friends! Seafood is fresh and delicious, but maybe on the expensive side for such a casual atmosphere."
1,"I went for a Saturday brunch and the line is out the door! The food is delicious and the service is great. The only downside is that when we were waiting for our table, the hostess kept telling us to wait 10 mins, another 10mins, another 10 mins. We ended waited around for half an hour. Luckily they have a bar so we can hang out there... but we were starving!"
1,"Great food, great atmosphere, great service! Everything I have had here is incredible - I highly suggest the crab meat taquitos! They are also very good with food allergies and special requests."
0,loved the tacos will come back
1,"This has to be my favorite Cuban restaurant in all NYC.  Even at its old location I made it a priority to be a regular. Its a bit on the pricey side but so worth it all. The food is incredible, from appetizers to desert. I highly recommend the yuca fries, the great and delicious bread with their dip and a taste of the flan. NEVER ever leave without trying the White tropical sangria! So delicious!!! plus, sangria buffet on Sundays, who can complain?"
0,"One of the best deals for a great, tasty meal on the UES that I've found.  As Turkish restaurants go, it is far and away my favorite in this part of the city. The swordfish kebabs were an amazing deal !  The Mezze Platter is a must try.  Great outdoor seating in the warm months.  A great place for locals, and worth the trip from another part of Manhattan (even for notoriously lazy Manhattanites!) ."
0,"not much of a choice for vegetarians other than the split pea ravioli and salads. and i'm sorry, i haven't got the salary to drop 18 bucks on a salad. if i'm paying that much money, it better be for something that'll sit good n heavy in my belly. the wine list was alright, but the choices were more with bottles rather than by the glass. went here for a friend's bday/farewell party so didn't really have a choice in the venue. the split pea ravioli was yummy, but the unending bread basket was the only way i actually walked away with a full stomach. i don't think the food was worth the price. the atmosphere was energetic, but got too loud towards the end, to a point where i would rather have stayed quiet than try to participate in the conversation over the din around us. the main reason they have 3 stars is the waitress. she had the most annoying attitude. i wanted to tell her, honey, you don't own the place, you work here, so let's not forget that i pay your rent and bring your nose back down"
0,"This is the best pizza in the WORLD! by the slice, all you're gonna get is cheese, but it is the perfect piece of cheese pizza! Call in a whole pizza to take home and you won't be disappointed. Small seating area, so you may have to walk and eat. Very friendly staff. Prices are great, too. I would eat it EVERYDAY...!!"
0,"Great place.  Been here several times and always good.  Fish cooked right, fried chicken always good, ribeye even though 1/2in thick was cooked to order (med rare), good oysters, and great staff.  One of the best American Bistros in the city.  I almost hate to rate so high because of potentially drawing more of a crowd but I feel that I owe it to the owner (or GM) who was so accommodating.  Especially since it was prime dinner time and we had a baby, which isn't always the case at other places in the city.  Keep it up!"
1,The main reason I came to Le Barricou was because it was voted Best Brunch in Williamsburg on Menupages or Citysearch.  I was not dissapointed with the decision to go.  The brunch menu was great and the alcohol selection is quite vast.  I had a chocolate stout that was almost as good as a pint of Guiness.  The spinach crossaint and the croque madame were to die for.
1,There wasn't much of a line and the wait for the food was decent. I tried the triple pork sandwich and got it mild. It was pretty darn good. Definitely wouldn't mind coming here again! (: The people at the booth were also really friendly. Try this place!
0,"I always want to like this place because it's so convenient if you intend to go out after dinner, but quite frankly it's just not that good and the service is really not that nice."
1,"I just had Sunday brunch here and the food and atmosphere was great. I ordered the Zona Sur Grande and my boyfriend had the Croque Moussier, which we both enjoyed very much. The brunch waitress seemed a bit frazzled and commented to a couple that the restaurant has gotten busier, so obviously it's doing well! Although having the kitchen waiter serve the dishes was effective, they could've done with another brunch waitress. As I said before, the atmosphere was great because everyone was so appreciative of a nice, affordable brunch spot here in Sunset Park. Mimosas, however, are set at Manhattan prices ($10/glass), so I went with the white sangria at $7 (again, Manhattan price) and it was tasty. I wish it had more fruit - it was all apples - but it was good nonetheless. I will definitely be coming back for dinner!"
1,"i don't think i had really ever had sushi before sushi yasuda. the sushi and maki i sampled here made it painfully obvious that all the other ""sushi"" i'd eaten in my lifetime were merely impostors.  this is the kind of place where i felt comfortable eating anything the chefs prepared for me, knowing without a shadow of a doubt that it would be exquisite. excellent service, phenomenal sushi, and a truly memorable experience.  i'll definitely be returning"
0,"this place is ssssssooooooo worth the trip. their scramble egg n potato with mozzarella cheese is 2 die 4. and the bread.....oohh man! if u visit this place and have something negative to say about it, we'll find u....just playing. but seriously, its the best, and worth every cent."
0,"Just feels like home !!! I work and live in Manhatann, but i'm from Nice south of France and i love to go in this funky and relaxing area of Williamsburg. Pates et traditions is my favorite spot when i feel nostalgic, and i can tell you that everything in this charming little place , from the decoration to the food the ambiance and last but not least the chef is authentic. The pissaladiere is the best i've ever had, Laurent is probably the only one cooking this traditional dish ""la Socca"" from Nice in NY , and about the crepe...delicious, each one of them! The staff is very friendly and professional, the food is wonderful and the place as well, and it's definitely cheap... I can't wait to go back!!!"
1,"2 aspects that will make sense of all reviews below: 1. Great food but only if you get the special.. even if it doesn't sound appetizing, it will be your best bet, and will be amazing in the end.  Everything else was just average food that could have come from anywhere (hence the reviews that are so-so) - the specials seem to be their farm-to-table specialty (not just your average special) 2.  Since the place is egregious with your time in terms of waiting for a seat (no reservations accepted but you will wait for a REALLY long time as you eyeball a few empty tables), consider directly inquisitive tactics, using visible gestures towards tables are open, and realize the situation below: Their seating strategy for brunch: We were a party of two - same number as 80% of the parties waiting to eat, however we all heard the names called for parties WAY further down the list from us who were a larger party.. we waited about an hour longer than our original 30 minute wait time.. so if you are hungry, call people nearby to meet for brunch, or possibly even go so far as to just make up a number LARGER than two.. Otherwise enjoy your food - as it is really good.  Also amazing Lemonade."
1,I know; it's crazy to think that you would wait over an hour in line to pay more than 99 cents for a bowl of ramen but this was definitely worth it.  The flame broiled piece of fatty pork was the icing on the cake.
1,"I normally hate buffets, but make an exception for Woorijip.  The staff does a remarkable job of keeping the place clean, and the food fresh and tasty.  The sheer variety of the food is almost overwhelming when you walk in.  I am often faced with the uncomfortable situation of getting overly greedy, and with some embarrassment, acknowledge to the cashier that i've picked up almost 2 lbs of food (hey, rice is heavy stuff man!). The variety also comes with unintended consequences.  It's no secret that kimchi causes excessive burping.  Perhaps it's the fermentation process still at work in the stomach, or more likely, it's the thousands of years of culture, which accepts public burping as acknowledgement of a good meal. Kimchi burps are foul and terrible things on their own, but when combined with the variety of food found at Woorijip, the effects are compounded into new and evil combinations.  For example: Kimchi + kim bap =  The nori (seaweed) wrapper causes evil burps when combined with the kimchi.  We're talking evil Gary Oldman from Air Force One combined with evil Gary Oldman from the 5th Element.  Yeah, that evil. Kimchi + bulgogi = Truly noxious. Imagine your worst White Castle burp ever, with a topping of kochujang (red pepper paste).   Kimchi + japchae = Nearly as obnoxious as Paris Lohan Spears. Kimchi + deokkboki =  Forget it stud, all the booking in the world isn't going to get you a girl after you've had this combo. Bad burps aside, Woorijip is a great place to pick up a quick, inexpensive and comforting meal.  Just know that you won't be kissing anyone after eating this stuff (unless they're Korean too) More Woorijip coverage: midtownlunch.com/categor…"
0,ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE WAIT! The food is incredible! The service is fantastic and the desserts are worth saving room for!!
1,"Even on a Monday night this place is buzzing. I managed to sit on the counter facing the kitchen, which afforded me a view on the well oiled machine which is the kitchen. So far, this is the only tasty food I've eaten in New York. Food in America tends to be be bland or just horribly over seasoned. Not at L'Artusi, which makes great tasting food."
1,"Although Boqueria thinks and feels it offers out-of-this-world tapas, the food is merely OK at this new SoHo outpost. The restaurant continues the stunningly acceptable recent tradition of New York tapas bars charging appetizer and, worse, main course prices for small plates. A special-of-the-day dish of gambas al ajillo for $13 consisted of 5-6 rock shrimp (the tiny kind) swimming in a pot of hot olive oil. When I inquired about the dish to the waiter, and later on, to the manager, I was told that this is what the dish is all about and that customers rave about it. Perhaps customers who have never had gambas al ajillo before, have no problem paying up 13 bucks for oily mini shrimp and relish the idea of anything swimming in a vat of oil. I am not one to tell a chef how to create a dish, but I will speak up when I find the result insulting to me as a diner, even if my table mates shudder at the idea (sorry Karsten!). Besides the shrimp fiasco, Boqueria delivered in terms of a neighborhood bistro: the staff was unusually friendly and uber smiley, and the manager, Zack, was an affable and charming man, a dying breed in this city's restaurant scene. With a little more thought into the food menu (if you're going to charge this much for tapas, let's get more creative with the choices people!) and the music (cheesy rock n' roll at a SoHo tapas bar? really? really?), Boqueria can capitalize on its elegant looks, casual vibe, and friendly service to become a much-needed neighborhood hangout."
1,"So pricey but so good ... service at the bar is awesome, friendly, professional ... Provence Rose was some of the best wine I've had .... agnolotti with lobster: amazing ... my niece had escargot --  not my favorite, but the sauce was delicious to dip bread in ... only quibbles ... annoying couple standing to close to me at bar! the bread could have been fresher ... the heirloom tomato salad should have been more flavorful ..."
0,"Went for brunch.  Delicious. Price agreeable.  The Spinach and Goat Cheese Croissant was phenomenal! Service, delightful, clear, professional.  There is a definite need for two bartenders on Sunday.  It seemed as though the man that was working was over- worked and annoyed at the notion. Bathrooms too dim, but the lovely soap makes up for it.  Will return."
1,"~review for happy hour only~ Met up with a friend after work. Located a little off the busy streets by Washington Square, this was a perfect spot to relax and catch up over drinks. The place is cozy, and has a decorative but non pretentious feel. We sat in the movie theater seats by the window. The happy hour is such a great deal. Any flight of wines for $10, and you can choose from the entire list! My friend had a hard time deciding, so he asked the server to pick his flight for him. The server was cool about it and just asked a few questions about what kind of wine my friend liked (light, dry). For my flight, I picked a Riesling, Malbec, and Montepulciano. We also ordered the two happy hour appetizers, which were goat cheese and escargots. First, the wines. Even though it says samples, these were pretty much whole glasses. We enjoyed all of them. It's also a great way to try out wines that you might not be familiar with, as my friend did.  The appetizers were delicious as well. The goat cheese was warm, crusted with pistachios and atop a bed of caramelized onions and drizzled with honey. Served with crusty bread, this is soooo good! The escargots were soft, tender, and covered in butter and pesto. Yum! Definitely will come back to try out their dinner menu."
0,"We had a reservation for an early Sunday dinner. We arrived on time, and were promptly sent to the bar. The overpriced cocktail was just OK. The bartender seemed like she could care less and directed her attention elsewhere. There were two obnoxiously loud groups in the dining room; one of which was right smack in the center of the room. Romantic dinner plans foiled. We thought the flavors were good, though the apps and entrees we had were tiny and overpriced. There's a good reason they have unlimited bread and butter (the salted butter was good). The beet salad was good. The potato truffle ravioli filling was thin and runny, but it had a burst of cream and truffle flavor so I went with it. My companion loved the scallop entree but was also still hungry afterwards. The generous, homey and playful desserts seemed gargantuan in comparison, and seemed to fit the decor better but didn't match the dinner. Not a seamless meal."
1,"I'm not from around here but I do know one thing, if I'm ever in the area, I will definitely be hitting up Cafeteria again. A quick search for a sweet brunch spot in the area turned up this place so I have Yelp to thank for the nice suggestion. Located on the corner of the block, they have a small patio area with a connecting indoor section that allows for a cool breeze for those sitting inside. The wait was about 30 minutes so we sat at the bar and I ordered a blueberry basil soda to hold me over. The soda was amazing but now that I think of it, I should have gotten some alcohol to compliment this brunch! I also tried my girlfriend's blackberry lemonade which was slightly sour with a hint of sweetness to it. Both of which were good but the soda was slightly better. Luck for us, our waiter sat us on the inside right on the border of the outside patio. This not only allowed for a nice view of outside, but provided a nice breeze on this perfect day. Looking over the many brunch choices, I decided to go with a country flatbread - baked eggs, prosciutto, asparagus, cooked in a truffle oil and decorated with some pecorino on a flatbread. I thought overall, the meal tasted good but the bread was a little too crispy. Let's just say that while it was good, I'll likely order something different the next time I'm here. Overall, I thought this was a nice little place to grab some brunch and would definitely check it out again if I get the opportunity. The ambience is just right for a brunch restaurant and the drinks (even ""cocktails"") are pretty good. Sweet food, sweet drinks makes for a plus in my book."
0,"The pizza is good, BUT the service is the worst we have ever received. The drunkard at the door, Ralphie, randomly selected people to be seated; order didn't matter. He yelled at one person in our group, which caused many people in line to leave ...in retrospect, we should have done the same. The servers were if the grumpy kind, too. Go to the place next door, they'll greet you with a smile."
0,"My first time visiting New York I had dinner at The Breslin and had a terrible experience.  Nonetheless I had heard good things about The Spotted Pig, and I thought I would give April Bloomfield another shot since I know she is so respected.  We had no issues being seated, they actually even extended the lunch menu for us even though we were seated after 3 pm (the usual cutoff for lunch). We had the chicken liver toast, which was good, even though it's hard to get through that much liver sometimes.  My real problem was with the entrees. My girlfriend had a dish that was 16 dollars and literally consisted of about 6 thin slices of speck and about 6 or seven roman (tiny) artichoke hearts.  It was average at best. My 20 dollar burger was good, though the Roquefort was a little bit overpowering.  And though the shoestring fries were good, they did not make up for the price of the slightly above average burger.  My two other friends ordered Cuban sandwiches which they said were good, but a little dry.   Service was ok, though a bit Inattentive at times.  The atmosphere is very laid back, which was nice.  In the end though, the food disappointed and was overpriced.  I hate to say it, but this place defines overrated."
1,"Probably the best Schnitzel I've ever had. Mostly because of its accompaniments. The jam, the cucumber slaw and potato salad are all on point. The spaetzle, on the other hand, was rather bland comparatively. That said, one of the non-German dishes was very strong. The snapper was delish- almost like something you'd expect to be served at Nobu. And last but not least, the decor- the true star of Edi. It's Edward Scissorhands meets barn chic. Very creepy cool. Definitely worth the change of pace."
1,"I was so excited when I was able to score a reservation at the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare.  I've heard that it is one of the most difficult restaurants to get into (such as Per Se), so I literally almost had an accident in my pants when I got through on their reservation line!  Brooklyn Fare is a grocery store that has been around the Brooklyn neighborhood for ages; the owner of the store, Moe Issa, wanted to add a restaurant, and found Chef Cesar Ramirez to partner up with to open up a restaurant that features the fresh produce (the Chef's Table is not IN the grocery store, but located a few doors down).  The restaurant is an intimate 18-seat space where the menu is never known until the day of to finalize, and it is up to Chef Ramirez and his team to plate over twenty small plate courses for you to enjoy.  It is predominately shell-fish oriented and Japanese-influenced.  I was star struck when I saw Chef Ramirez, literally right there in person, all hands-on with the plating, the clearing, and even presenting the plates.  You can tell that he has very high expectations, very attentive to details, extremely focused, and very passionate about food.  He is reserved, but he is definitely cool if you get a chance to chit-chat with him (my husband was able to engage in a conversation while I went to the restroom - darn my weak bladder!!!).  You aren't allowed to take pictures or take notes, and there is no copy of the menu, so that was a little upsetting for me (since I am so OCD with taking pictures of all my food), but it really gave me the opportunity to enjoy each dish without focusing on snapping away.  I loved watching the Chef and his team plate each dish meticulously, and being presented with a little info from the lone server in the center (she stated that she has to jump in and out!).  I remember each dish being extremely delicious, perfectly seasoned, beautifully presented, and a great portion size so that you leave happily content - the amount being served lets you enjoy each of the ingredients while not being too under- or overwhelmed.  Out of respect for the Chef and the restaurant, I will not list all the dishes I memorized, but some of my favorites/highlights included: the sea urchin/uni porridge, the caviar, the shiso sorbet, the melting ball of chocolate with the butterscotch ice cream, and the little tray of mini desserts with 23K gold flakes (yum yum YUM!).  It was definitely a great experience, and I loved that we were able to try this place out to celebrate our anniversary! :D  I also like the fact that you don't have to whip out your card to pay at the end, as what you used for your reservation is automatically charged for the party, the service charge, as well as the gratuity - I really thought that that was quite convenient!  So instead of a bill, you get a nice handwritten message, thanking you :D  The group of friendly sweet folks who sat to the left of us were so much fun with a great sense of humor - it was a great evening, and I would love to come back again and try out their ever-changing menu!  :D"
1,Pay the money and drink these margs the pomegranate is delicious and the spicy cucumber is top notch Food is upscale Mexican so the day you feel lol spending more than 2 bucks on a taco here's your place?
0,"I've eaten at a couple Grey Dog locations in the city. I think the food is great and the cappuccino is fantastic! But the atmosphere is stressful! It's not a good place to go if you want to relax and be served that is for sure. Or if you are waiting for a friend to arrive as you really can't just sit and enjoy a coffee. I arrived slightly before my friend and waited in line, hoping she would get there before I got to the front. Since she didn't make it in time, I ended up having to retreat back to the end of the line until she got there. I understand they are trying to be laid back and they probably think this more efficient, but I believe it may be less efficient. It just makes more sense to do normal table service, especially when it gets super crowded on a Saturday. It's too difficult to have your customers getting up to get their own utensils and water, while dodging people waiting in line to order."
0,"Very good spot for a quick bite if you are not too picky. The salads are very nice, but I was a bit disappointed about the Pho, since the meat was fatty. But hey!. You cannot beat the inexpensiveness fast service and the bubble tea. Forget the dirty tables. Still a treat!"
0,"Was not familiar with the original one in Astoria, but was pleasantly surprised by this place. Food is solid and portions are titanic. Atmosphere is clean and bright; certainly a welcome change from the dimness of the taco place that was in this location previously. A great addition to the neighborhood."
0,You are over priced and have average food.....and by firing one of my favorite bartenders you only prove that you do not value your local customers that come in there only becasue of your staff. I won't be going back!
0,This place is completely not worth it.  They're way too pretentious for serving mediocre coffee and lattes.  It's worth the trip to the city for Stumptown coffee or Cafe Grumpy.  At least they know what they're doing.  This one's a FAIL.
0,"The night I got engaged, my fiancé and I some how randomly found Woodrow's. They technically weren't ""open"" but were having a preview night for who ever stumbled in. What a great bar we found! The staff is so nice and there's excellent beers on tap (Try the half Guinness half Blueberry Ale - it's so good!) Woodrow's is a must try!"
0,"this place is way overhyped. the burgers are ok, bt they're a pretty low class version of a good hand formed burger. the place itself is cute and rusitc, but to wait an hour for a burger you can get of equal or better quality at just about any pub just doesn't make sense to me. the toppings are below average, and the only choice of ""cheese"" is american? give me a break, that's not even cheese! the cheap whitebread bun you can buy at a supermarket (white rose brand), and the boring, usually undercooked plain white fries, although are palatable, are also unremarkable. bathrooms are cramped and filthy. they stink like piss and there's piss all over the floor (sometimes puke, or puke smell), and no privacy should you want to use the bowl. the place usually stinks of stale beer soaked into the floor. although overall the place isn't bad, and on  day when it's not busy and you're in the area, you can do worse than sitting here for a burger and beer, i have to give it one star because it's really nothing special IMO; there are much better burgers in the city which get no recognition on any list  (e.g. le monde, maybe because it's uptown) and to help bring the overall rating of this place more in line with where it should be. OK, but not the great place the hype machine makes it out to be. try a burger here, and then at le monde and then you'll see what i mean. *update-last 3 visits/burgers at le monde; it has slipped). *update #2- i've upgraded my rating, only because it's not a place to stay away from, i've had delicious burgers here, but i think this place is overhyped, and the stars this place gets is not representative of the quality of burger you get."
1,"Great pizza, Good  Homely Atmosphere, Long wait. The brick oven pizza is definitely the highlight of this little corner in Nolita. Bake to eat as you order and topped with traditional Italian toppings, this is one of the places where you can get feel of real italian pizza in NY. The tight space gives the place a traditional Little Italy atmosphere with the gracious service to go with it. As with all other well known places with good food, the wait here is alittle undesirable for a native New Yorker like me who wants everything quick and on the spot, but the foodie in me says its all worth it when you take that first bite. DO: Come for the food and atmosphere DO NOT: Come with big groups"
1,"I really love chinese food and this place is one of those gems in Chinatown.  It is one of those places you have to wait a while to be seated.  It is community seating so you sit at a round table with lots of strangers.   This place is known for the soup dumplings and they are so delicious.  You can make a meal out of eating just them but there are so many other good things on the menu.   One of my favorite things to do while waiting is to go across the street to the foot and back massage place and have a foot rub.  I look forward to the whole experience.  I  finally got my sister to go there with her husband and she is hooked on the foot massage too oh yeah, and she loves the dumplings. Give it a try it is worth the wait to be seated and don't be turned away when you see the swarm of people outside waiting.  After all it is NY and the place is small and packed so the only place to wait is outside."
0,"All the awesome things: cheesy grilled cobcorn. Soft tacos. Frozen margaritas. Outdoor seating, huge. Allegedly green recycling and energy-consumption. Bad things: always a long line (already been mentioned in other reviews). Only one sometimes two cashiers. = slow. No dogs allowed, because have to walk through the inside to get to the outside garden, if you know what I mean. To me, outdoors space in NY is wasted if it doesn't allow dogs. Despite its downsides, irresistable and great place to bring friends and family when they're visiting and want something refreshing yet neighborhoody."
0,Fantastic pizza! This place never lets me down !!
0,"Came for brunch last weekend.   I had heard stories about long waits here but that wasn't the case with us. Super friendly girl sat us. I ordered the eggs with biscuits and gravy. I swore I wasn't in New York City, but a countryside diner. Really warm and fuzzy delicious. The prices are quite fair with the neighborhood.  I will come again, perhaps for dinner."
0,"This has become our ""go to"" bar in the neighborhood.  Romantic lighting, friendly waitstaff, fresh organic ingredients, great selection of wine - what's there not to like?   The waiters let us try a few wines to make sure we got exactly what we wanted.  We ordered some food, not expecting a gourmet meal.  Was very pleasantly surprised.  The salad was delicious - with truffles and pickled artichoke.  Stuffed mushrooms were perfect - mozzarella, bread crumbs, sour cream, and a touch of prosciutto.  And a margherita pizza for the main course - expertly cooked.   A super chill and relaxing place to hang out.  I like that they don't allow people to work on their computers there!  It's a wine bar, people.   I'd give them five stars, but I'm scared that Yelp will think they've paid me to review and will end up filtering me!"
1,A hole in the wall..  But the tacos are amazing
0,"THIS PLACE IS MIND BLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are two thing I completely love in this world and it's spicy food and ramen noodles! Their pork buns are too die for ! Best service I have ever received !!! Super friendly staff, they all greet you loudly the min you walk in. But make sure to either go early or close to closing anything in between that is considered "" happy hour"" turns into a two hour wait (boo!)"
0,"Solid taco's, brought me back to my days in SoCal."
0,We had dinner at Carmine's before watching Phantom ... it was less than a block away. I had made reservations for 5:30pm but unfortunately arrived late. The hostess wasn't exactly pleased with us but still made every effort of seating us withing 5 minutes of our arrival. I thought that was great customer service ... considering the mob of people waiting to be seated. The Penne Alla Vodka and Chicken Parmigiana was the best I've ever had.
0,"great night out with good food in a really nice restaurant, wood definitely come again, portions are so big order a share salad and share entree, and take some home."
1,"Great autentic thai food, swanky interior, friendly & efficient service.  Would definitely eat here again!"
0,"Oh em geeeeee the ramen is the best, hands down! The broth is just soooo delicious that I can drink all of it and my bowl will be clean by the end of dinner. The pork buns are good too! I love the bread they use. So nice and fluffy! Lychee martini is killer here too. So don't be surprised if you're stumbling out of the restaurant because they make some strong drinks here. But delicious! Just be prepared to wait. It gets ridiculously crowded here. I mean like having to wait 2 hours just to eat kind of crowded!!"
0,"So, I came here on a recommendation and I'm glad I did. From the outside it didn't seem as spacious as it really is - on my journey to the VIP room (aka THE BATHROOM) i saw a third room in the back. I requested to the hostess to sit there and she said that would be okay). BOOZE: At the bar while I waited I had a cocktail called ""citrus and something"". The ""something"" isn't part of the name - I just forget what it was called - it was very good but very dangerous, as in one turned in to 3.... The hostess told me it would be about 10 minutes for the table I requested - it ended up being 15-20mins. FOOD: I had the pasta with rabbit and its hard to do rabbit well - they succeeded. Very tender and tasty. I then had the folded chicken (I know, 2 entrees, give me a break i was HUNGRY!). It's hard to get excited over chicken but the folded chicken was spot on - perfect texture. I think the figs that it's served with was the clincher for me... WHY NOT 5 STARS: You can't tell me it's going to be 10mins and then have me wait 15-20."
1,"This review is for a solid 3.5 stars. What a cool attraction in Chinatown. Tasty hand pulled noodles is situated on a cool winding street, so random that we almost missed the place. It's so small, I was shocked we got a table rather quickly. Please know what you want, and don't ask questions ( tricky right?). The ladies working are sweet, but are women of few words. I ordered the duck ramen soup, and my bf ordered the beef version ( forgot the names for both!). Our soup came out pipping hot immediately. Wayyy too hot to eat until like 10 minutes of cooling.. Anyways the noodles were good- freshly made, nice consistently. The meat.. Eh, mediocre at best. Overall, Not a bad place, but I've had better. Fyi, you may feel a bit rushed as the tiny crowd growing outside is staring at your table. I'll be back again just to take a picture on the cool winding road. That's probably about it."
1,"Delicious foods with reasonable price because they have a live band singing, clean, nice decoration, good service, and good atmosphere overall. The foods price are actually pretty expensive compare to other Tibetan/Nepali restaurants out there in Jackson Heights, but the price you pay for this restaurant is definitely worth it without any regrets."
0,"The best part about this place is the view of the Brooklyn Bridge while you wait in line...a very long line. I was kept entertained for a while taking pictures but we waited for over an hour to get into a cramped table. Because there were 5 of us it took even longer for a table to be available. The pizza was good but, really, how can you ruin pizza? If ordering ahead to pick it up is an option I would suggest that. Like I said the pizza was good but the atmosphere wasn't worth the wait."
1,"I've been coming here for years, and one thing never fails... xiao long bao (XLB!), piping hot soup filled dumplings (they come in crab and pork). I think Joe's has gotten a lot of hype of the years, but the pork XLB are consistently good. I prefer those to the crab ones, but I know a lot of people who love the crab ones as well. I usually pop in here and order a few orders of the XLB and that's it. The XLB here are slightly different than the ones served in Los Angeles and the West Coast. The soup in the dumplings is darker, richer, and has more of a salty soy flavor. Most of the XLBs in California have a clear broth in the dumpling. Both are good, but I would have to say they're different from each other. Anyway, I often get asked how to eat them. Here's how I eat them without managing to burn my entire oral cavity. I pick up the XLB in a spoon in my left hand and with my right hand i slightly lift the dumpling off of the spoon by the top (pursed part). I make a small nick of a bite in the upper portion of the skin of the dumpling. I turn the dumpling over and pour the soup out onto my spoon to let it cool. Then I eat proceed to eat the dumpling and soup together in one spoonful/mouthful. And there you go. My XLB eating technique. Try it out."
1,Great pizzas near the neighbourhood. Cheap and cheerful! Straight out from the oven! Highly recommend
1,"Very nice wine bar. Great crowd. Food is very good, with reasonable prices. We ate in the back outdoor garden."
1,Loved this place! Came here for a late night bite with friends. We were all starving and this food definitely hit the spot. The servings were huge and either came with soup or salad. I had a chicken club sandwich and my husband had the hangar steak with ravioli. So yummy! The service was a little slow but the food was great. The place looks great I love the decor. I would definitely come back and try out other things on the menu.
1,"Love this place! It' s open until late hours. The food is delicious, my favorite dish is the beet gnocchi. The wine list is great as well."
0,the best pizza

1,"Judging by all the positive reviews, maybe I went on a (very) off day, but my experience was very underwhelming. I ordered the roast chicken entree which came with a large quarter chicken (leg and thigh), yellow rice and black beans, and maduros. The server put in a ton of rice, but only a splash of black beans and three pieces of maduros. I asked him for more maduros and he put a couple more in but said the container would be hard to close. (Other reviewers mentioned that they were given 2 containers which he could have done here instead of trying to give me 3 little pieces of maduros as a side.) The chicken was very tender, but it was also very bland. Even the skin was bland. (If there was supposed to be sauce I wasn't given any.) I'd describe it as a soft meat product with a sodium-free, mild chicken flavor. The maduros and the beans were fine but the generous serving of rice was super gross. It was mushy and had a strange flavor, like it might have been an old batch that was stored in the refrigerator without a cover and just reheated. Basically, it tasted stale and a bit like chemicals. I'm not hard to please when it comes to rice but I had to throw it all away. I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 since I was given a lot of chicken and yellow rice (if portions matter to you more than flavor) and the people who work there seem friendly."
0,"The buffet food taste very good. Still no free water or tea and we are expected to pay for the bottled water. There is so much wasted plastic after each meal; just look around. The owner has no environmental conciusneness. Another small issue: The receipt is not itemized. When you buy buffet (per pound), soup and other items, the total due amount  is a mystery. They don't tell you how much the buffer food weights/costs. Like I said the food tastes good. They can do much better with other issues. My biggest issue: STOP BEING CHEAP AND OFFER FREE TAP WATER SO THAT WE DONT HAVE TO CONSUME YET ANOTHER PLASTIC BOTTLE."
1,"Sitting at the bar, eating perogies and potato pancakes, watching the cooks multitask like it's some reality television competition, which I think the people at Stage could dominate.  This little hidden gem is everything that's great about the East Village. Not expensive and the best comfort food for a wintry day."
1,"Only have dined via take out or delivery, but the food is always delicious. Their veggie burger is my favorite in the city. I'm a fan."
0,"I go out to eat about 3 times a week and its always the same food...Japanese. I found Mew Izakaya on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It is a great place to eat and chill, the place was very nice and the staff was great, the food is even better."
1,"Went last night with husband and daughter. It is a pretty cool,buzzing place and I felt happy to be there. The food was good. We had fish tacos, Mac and cheese chicharonnes, and seviche to start, then hubby had a big Caesar with avocado and my daughter and I had a nice skirt steak with plantains and rice and beans. Nice big dinner, we each had a drink, and the bill was a little over a hundred bucks. Good value, cool place."
0,"One of my top five restaurants in Manhattan.  Unfortunately, we have a hard time limiting our choices and the bill does add up, so we save this place for birthdays and anniversaries.  But, god I love the food and the service here!!  This is a must-do, people..."
1,"Great service, enjoyable dining environment. Their soba is better than Sobaya. Lunch set costs about $20; might be good to give it a try."
0,"Anyone who gave this restaurant less then 5 stars is wrong, 5 stars should be the only option for this place.     Came here for first time with 4 buddies from long island, and although we waited a bit, Danny? the owner did more then right the ship. Danny was created to run fine restaurants and fine food.   I have not stopped thinking about that pork chop. only read the 5 star reviews there all that matters.  See ya, place is dope"
0,been going for years. everything is delicious.
0,we come here for special occasions as it has that old school dinning experience.  nothing is flash just traditionally beautiful.  the food and service are phenomenal.  they always have stunning flora arrangements and the cheese is to die for.
0,"I was so upset every time I walked by and saw that the gate was closed. This became my favorite lunch break spot last year when they first opened. I passed by the restaurant today and I was greeted by the owners, I was so surprised when they recognized me and remembered my name! Awesome staff and great vibes, you'll be seeing me everyday!"
1,The chicken and pancakes is to die for I need their fried chicken recipe it's the best I've ever had!! The cheese grits and coop platter always a great variety of food all was freshly made and fresh tasting the homemade jam on a biscuit is a must!! Great place for brunch and has outdoor seating so you can bring your pup! Will definitely be back it's a great neighborhood gem.
0,"Why so much buzz about that place? Soho might not have such great places to go. Went there for the first time last weekend for brunch, wait was 45 minutes, ordered the chicken kebab, which on the description said if was marinated, coming with couscous. This chicken was extremely dry, could not be marinated to end like that, not tender at all. The couscous? That's was not a couscous, it's was simply plain and cold semolina and the chopped salad had no dressing, not even olive oil and lemon like most Mediterranean restaurant do. How can you miss a dish like that? i def would not come back. Huge disappointment, it's simply a small diner with a cute name."
1,"I've tried just about every bánh mì here... is that sad? Haha. The traditional one is good (but do not compare it to your fav spot in Chinatown). The Bulgogi bánh mì, HANDS DOWN, BEST THING HERE... aside from the bánh mì fries which I dream about often... drooling onto my pillow... Put a Runny Fried Egg on EVERYTHING! The BBQ Pork and Lemongrass Chicken are great too but that Bulgogi... *stares off into space* TIP: If you check in on Yelp you get a BOGO Fried Egg. Bigger TIP: If you are a fan on FB, your loyalty card never expires! (Regular cards expire in 2 months - better start hittin the gym!)"
0,"Went again for dinner. Cosy corner table, really enjoyed the ambiance. My girlfriend had the thai mussels, I had the chicken with spaetzle. The mussels were super tasty. I even tried it with some bread. the chicken was moist and flavorful and the spaetzle very good. no starters we had dessert instead. Tarte tatin with vanilla ice cream and carrot cake. Really liked it especially the special carrot cake. Will definitively go back."
1,Go there during off hours to get a table! The chicken soup and guacamole and chips are amazing. I also come here for the margaritas. The tacos are decent but I recommend sticking to the soup and chips because they are packed full of awesome flavor.
0,"A very good place for dinner but reservations are a must! We went on a friday evening and although there were several tables available, the manager?? said they were already reserved and he would only be able to seat us if we ordered pizza or appetizers. However, after pulling some strings and name dropping, they were able to seat us in our own booth and were very accommodating. First impression of this place: very traditional Italian and family style restaurant. We sat in the back room which was more slower paced, and quiet enough to have a conversation and really enjoy our meal. It kind of reminds me of the restaurants where old Italian mobs would come and hang out. The waiter and manager (I'm assuming) was very nice and always asked if we needed anything, or if the food was good, etc. The chef even came out to great the customers that he knew which was very nice. They gave us a menu but I was told no one really orders from the menu and don't bother looking at it. Just order the specials instead. Yes, the specials are extensive and takes the waiter at least 5-8 minutes to rattle it out, but it's worth it. Just pay really close attention. Most of the pictures of dishes on Yelp come from the specials menu, so if you see something that you like in the pictures, they're most likely from the special's menu. I wanted the burrata and prosciutto dish as seen in pics on yelp but couldn't find it on the actual menu. That's because it's part of the special and was glad the waiter mentioned it otherwise I would have ordered the boring mozzarella and tomato appetizer that I always order. The burrata was amazing. The fresh mozzarella was stuffed with pine nuts, basil and roasted peppers and a few slices of prosciutto. I devoured this in minutes. The mozzarella was very soft and so was the prosciutto and the filling of pine nuts, basil and peppers added a different texture and flavor to it. I can eat this every day. My bf ordered the chicken soup special. This was probably my least favorite dish because it didn't taste like anything special and reminded me of the vegetable soup my dad makes all the time. I ordered the osso bucco with gnocchi and it was great. It was also the most expensive of the the dishes we had costing $40. If I knew the price, I would have thought twice about it but it's good to try it I guess. The meat was very soft and fell off the shank. I devoured the marrow from the shank. I love the buttery and distinct taste of marrow but I can see why some people don't like it. It was my first time eating gnocchi and I didn't like it at all but it's my personal preference. It was very soft  yet chewy but I was basically eating a ball of cooked dough...which is exactly what gnocchi is. I would order the dish again though if they can substitute the gnocchi with a different type of pasta like pappardelle or something lighter. My bf ordered the pappardelle rabbit ragu. It was my first time eating rabbit so I was a bit skeeved but it reminded me of duck meat and it tasted fine."
0,"Since I've tried for the first time in San Francisco, I fell in love with Banh Mih style sandwiches. We don't have this in Brazil (for now), so I eat every time I travel to US. Never tried this one, bur it's really good, lucky New Yorkers."
1,"Awesome place ! the food is delish ;) especially homemade crapes, plus all are big portions and reasonable price. The atmosphere is cute and quiet."
0,"First off, I need to review this place in context.  They have tasty sandwiches, but in comparison of what Banh Mi should be like, I found the sandwiches somewhat lacking.  That said, the sandwiches are certainly cheap eats and are worth it if you are on a budget.  If you are looking for a great sandwhich I think you can do better.  Why?  First off, both of our sandwiches came on baguettes that were stale.  To be fair, we picked up our sandwiches after 4pm, so perhaps they've gone bad?  But other reviewers have referenced stale bread, and that worries me.  Secondly, I've had numerous Vietnamese sandwiches from San Jose, CA and Orange County, CA.  Many times I've had them late in the afternoon, and the baguettes had that fresh, crusty outside and that wonderful, soft chewy inside, so reminiscent of a French bakery.  Perhaps this is how folks in NY like their bread?  Thirdly, we did order the BBQ pork sandwich.  The pork came in a manner similar to how you would have it in a BBQ bun (char siu bau, if you will).  That was strange for me, again, perhaps how folks in NY like their sandwiches?  In CA, the BBQ pork tends to come finely julienned, not minced.  Because the meat was more like the meat you get in a bun, it tasted ok (but different than the sandwiches in CA) but is was a different taste than I""m used to.  So, I'm not sure if I'm just used to a different style of sandwich, which is the reason for the lower rating.  Still, the taste was ok, just different.  If you're used to CA-style, then be forewarned."
0,your girl's favorite place. guarenteed. bring her here and you'll be happy too.
0,"As I originally from Thailand, I will give Sri Pra Phai  5 stars. They are absolutely great food. I went there many and many time for business, for meeting, for party and private dinner..... Too much to say about food in Sri Pra Phai. All I wan to say is...""You have to come here for the best Thai food in America"" This is the only one Thai restaurant that I gave 5 stars."
0,Don't really have much to add to the already rave reviews.  Good food.  Great atmosphere.  Cool crowd.  But in the end it's still about the pizza.
0,"If you're in NY, don't order those pizza by the slices that you see walking down the street because those are not fresh and will not do any justice to NY pizza. Do try Lombari's, wow awesome taste. We tried the clam pizza or clam pie they call it for $26, it can feed 2-4 people depending how much you eat. It is sauceless. Their salad was ok and I so wanted to try their regular pizza with tomato sauce that I saw on the table next to us. They ordered a simple pie with basil leaves and I loved the chucky mozerella slightly burnt by the oven. I will definitely go back there to try that!"
1,"Best veggie burger! And you can add ""cheese"" and ""bacon"". So good, and ""meaty""! Very good fries, with home made type ketchup. I would recommend this place to everyone! Can't wait to try more dishes."
1,The food is incredible.  The drinks are superb.  I highly recommend the mojitos and the sangria.  The service is very good and the atmosphere is fun.  I suggest making reservations because this place has been packed each time I go (which is always a good sign - right?!).   I have had the empanadas and the skirt steak along with several of their appetizers.  I have enjoyed EVERYTHING I have tried.  One of my family members has celiac disease and their gluten-free empanadas are just as delectable as the regular ones.  It is one of my favorite places and definitely worth the trek from Manhattan.
1,"This is just for the Tavern. So I love bread and I love butter, right? Gramercy Tavern has awesome bread while you wait, right? Well we went there for our anniversary on the 18th and I lovingly slathered soft butter all over a piece of bread. I sprinkled a pinch of sea salt they provided and then I began to devour this piece. Moments later I had that feeling. Y'know, the feeling you get when you're allergic to something and you get nauseated? The feeling of saliva rushing from the depths of your mouth to flush it clean of the offending item. The feeling I hadn't had since I ate a raw almond offered at a Hindu temple in high school.... yeah that one.  It hit me full force and nothing on the table could cure me of the feeling. And I still don't know what it was. I refused to experiment lest I get sick and not be able to eat anything. After I ran to the bathroom to rinse my mouth out with water I felt much better. Now onto the food. For starters I had the special which was lamb with corn, roasted baby peppers and these cute little tomatoes I forgot the name of. He had the paparadelle with lamb ragout which looked mouthwatering, but he said had too much swiss chard. I ate what he didn't. For the main course he had the hanger steak with fingerling potatoes, red Russian kale and bourbon sauce. Lots of kale, not too many potatoes. I ate the kale since he's not as fond of it as he thought. Now onto my main course... you're going to frown at me when you find out what I ordered because I let out a deep sigh once I saw it in front of me. I got... the meatball. It's just one huge meatball and I think I might have enjoyed the ones I got at the meatball place on the LES better. The potatoes were the best part. Actually, I started to frown before my food even came out because the couple to my right had someone order the meatball as well. Now, the woman got the kielbasa and that looked amazing. Her date looks just as disappointed as I was at the meatball and continued to do so as he ate. In fact, they swapped dishes because he was so upset at what was set before him. I'm going to chalk this up to my bad choice of entree and still keep my rating at 4 stars. I made up for it with dessert. He got the chocolate pudding with salted caramel brioche croûtons. I got the apricot bread pudding with sour cream ice cream and caramelized white chocolate. I also got one of the croûtons as garnish cause he's cute. I wasn't too enamored of the ice cream but the pudding and caramelized white chocolate combined with it to make something amazing happen in my mouth. It almost completely erased the memory of my nausea earlier.... until I crunched down on one too many hazelnuts."
0,"I guarantee you this place will be catering my wedding, whether they like it or not :)"
1,Spicy miso ramen! Loaded with veggies and tofu. Huge portion and probably could serve 2. Flavorful broth. My own complaint is that I find that there isn't a good noodle to broth ratio. It seems like my noodles always soak up the delicious broth.
0,"Ok last minute deal got reservation thruYelp. Awesome there. People here are super. Very tight space though. Tables too close. We basically were talking to neighboring tables.Two order: chicken and pork chop. Both were slightly over cooked, maybe sat on the warming tables, who knows. Wine was small bottle so menu prices are deceiving. Got 750ml bottle for price of larger one. basically ok for the last minute dash to theatre, but not something id' recommend for an important dinner dtae."
0,"after the first time i ate from here, i had high expectations. what i didn't know was that when i ate from there, they were only making quality food to develop a fan base. i've eaten there twice more and each time it's gotten worse. it takes a million and one years to get 3 tacos made and the guacamole, even though guac and chips is 8 bucks, is pretty bland these days. maybe i just go on the wrong days now. whatever."
0,dont go here if you can't eat pork  hahah
0,good food and like what they are doing. seating arrangement a bit crazy but whatever
0,"It was our first trip to NYC with my husband and 2 teenagers.   The concierge at our hotel suggested the Marshal for lunch.  Teenagers can be fussy but my 2 were blown away with the restaurants friendliness, quaint atmosphere and SUPERB food!   We loved it so much we went back for dinner on our last night.  Local products are used and as a tourist I love trying our local items.  They even had it down to the soft drinks and local wines - AWESOME!   If you are in NYC or about to got there, this restaurant is a must! Lisa, Alberta, Canada"
0,"This place is pathetic -- I would give zero stars if it was an option. They can't (or won't) even pull off a Burger King ""have it your way"". I went with two friends on a Monday night around 11. There were only a few people there, mostly at the bar. One of my friends wanted onions on his burger, but the waitress said they didn't have any. He persisted and got the waitress to admit that they had shallots. He asked to have those on his burger. She went to the kitchen to see if that was ""possible"". She came back and said they wouldn't do it. Then he asked for mayo on it, and she said they never have mayo in the place. We left."
1,"I've been here a number of times. Their food and service is average - neither terrible nor amazing. Their portions are generous. Now, their cheesecake..definitely the best in town. Resist the urge to try anything else and just go for the original slice, especially if it's your first time. They do the original the way it's supposed to be done. Good seating areas - very spacious. One tip: go after 8pm and you won't have to wait as long. If you go earlier, you'll likely be there along with those who are trying to catch the 8pm Broadway shows."
1,"This place only got 2 stars because of the bad service. Honestly food was tasty and not expensive. However, we really had a bad experience because of the waiters. I meant by that: we were told that the wait was about 10-20 min, we waited 30-45 min before having a table. Then we placed an order of 5 small dishes. They served us one that we did not order...and unfortunately, they just forgot one dish...we were told that the fifth dish took 20 min to cook,so after waiting almost 30-45 min, we finally asked the waiter were was out plate, (not to mention that nobody asked us if we were fine during this time...no water refill either) turned out that our food was not even prepared...They simply forgot. Anyway, we asked for the check and went elswhere to eat something. Bad luck or bad service? I don't know but I will not go back to figure it out!"
0,"In my opinion the best Banh mi in the neighborhood. After having to suffer through some pretty sub par sandwiches from others, I'm glad I found them. Their bread is crisp, fresh and the perfect compliment to the chicken or pork. I haven't tried anything other than the sandwiches, but based on how good they are, I'm sure the rest of the menu is on point."
0,"I have been coming here for years every time I am in NYC!!!  I love dumplings and for the price they have, get me 5 orders please!"
0,I had a groupon for this place so I decided to go one night with my girls. The mussels were eh. The fries were really soggy and way too salty. I've had mussels before and I'm sure it wasn't supposed to taste like that. We got a bottle of wine which was dirt cheap. Thats a plus. My friend had the chicken and she said it was moist. Maybe I just picked the wrong thing from the menu?
0,Wasn't sure if I was going to like southern food but this place sold me on it. Plus the service was excellent!! Ask for sigon to be your host she was very knowledge of the food and helped me order the perfect meal
0,Good place
1,"I think I need to move to NY so I can truly embrace the concept of brunch : ) We really don't do the brunch thing in Jersey, but I've become a big fan after today's experience at Sugar Freak. Cool place, tasty Louisiana dishes and bottomless Bloody Marys & Mimosas for an extra $10!!!......how can you go wrong??? Had the Cajun eggs Benedict with fried oysters.....delish.  The bananas foster French toast is also amazing, as was the fried chicken sandwich with Mac & Cheese.  As a bonus they were playing some great 80s music! You made a brunch believer out of me Sugar Freak :)))"
1,"Everything about this place is cool. It is very well designed, the food is awesome and the atmosphere is great. We had to wait about 40 min for a table. Not a big deal, we enjoyed a couple of shochu drinks while we were waiting. Most of the dining consists of big tables and chances are, you'll be seated at a table with other people. I'm a pretty private person but the tables were big enough so that it wasn't a problem. I love soup and no one makes soup like the various Asian cultures. The ramen was the best. I added a braised pork shoulder and an egg to mine but, even without it, it was full of roasted pork and other goodness. Everyone was friendly and there was lots of energy as people were greeted upon entering and thanked profusely in Japanese as they left. I am definitely going back next time I am in NYC."
1,"Wow. Awesome. A definite 5 star. What an awesome dinner. We had: Sheep's Milk Ricotta App. (Melts in your mouth) Two Lasagnas.  Not as good as my mother's, but up there. And for desert, the baby Jesus cake and the ""Chipwich"". (Both awesome) Very good service. Can't wait to return. Only thing to beware of is that they have a small menu and do not serve the traditional Italian restaurant dishes such as chicken parm, veal parm, everyt type of pizza, etc."
1,"If you can get past the long wait, then it should be worth it. The apps are good.  Wifey and I had the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (simple cucumber sliced with sesame oil, chili flakes and salt), Tako Wasabi (raw baby octopus in a chopped wasabi paste), pork buns, and at that time a Philly Cheesesteak Egg Roll.  Pork buns are pork buns, but the rest were awesome.  Wifey especially loved the Philly egg roll. The ramen is good.  The times we've been there, wifey's had the Miso ramen, the Karaka miso ramen and the Akamaru ramen.  I've had the Classic, Akamaru and a special Monkfish Shio ramen.  The one time we brought our girls, they enjoyed the ramen, too.   However, there's a reason people keeping getting pulled into the ramen.  It's called Ajinomoto.  You taste it and you're drinking tons of water after because of it.  But that's the way it is."
1,"Great panini and salads. They gave us free samples of freshly-made, still warm mozzarella."
0,"What makes these fries so special? It's not just their delicious double-fried extra crispiness or the great salt to potato ratio. It's actually the variety of sauces you can get with the fries. Some really great choices are the mango chutney mayo, parmesan peppercorn and the black truffle mayo. It costs $2 but it's well worth it!"
0,"This was a busy, noisy restaurant, full of people having a good time. It was relaxed and friendly. The service was good and the food very fresh and tasty. Not a good place for a quiet dinner but great if you have noisy kids as no one will notice!"
0,"Botttom line:  good, OK, not amazing.  Certainly does not qualify for its food rating of 27 on Zagats (at least not by Manhattan standards).  This is no Il Mulino (a restaurant surely deserving its 27 food rating).  Would not again make the trip over the bridge.  We found the secret service like earpieces on the waite staff odd and the decor was kind of cheesey.  The risotto was excellent, as close to perfect as it gets.  Nothing else was special or memorable."
1,This place is awesome. I have gone here several times with my bf and then again a few times with my girlfriends. I always get the Shrimp and Grits and I TOTALLY love it. The last time I was there they didn't have the shrimp and grits so I got the french toast. I wasn't a big fan of this dish. It was too sweet for me. The sparkling lemonade is good. My bf loves the biscuits and gravy. We will definitely go again and again because it's in the neighborhood! The waitress and waiter aren't the most hospitable but they can be tolerated and are not rude. I just expect a friendlier attitude. All in all...GO HERE FOR BRUNCH!!!
0,Great Place !! Im such a big fan of Gaia Italian Cafe. Definitely will be coming back for more.
1,"Evidently they have brunch no - who knew?!  The hubby had the breakfast BLT, a decadent French toast with super crispy bacon and poached eggs with tomato compote and spinach.  I had the smoked fish with poached eggs over herbed creme fraiche and potatoes.  Will be coing back just for these dishes!! Server was brand new and a bit slow/pokey; not super attentive, especially because it wasn't too busy.  But we sat in the beautiful back garden, which garners a little less attention, otherwise it would have been a solid 5 stars.   Love this place.  Cozy and romantic for drinks and night, and now obviously for brunch on the weekend."
0,"Beautiful delicious secret tucked on the UES. Romantic.. Place has a tiny bar and maybe seats for 12 people, little 2 tops. Amazing food, the menu changes daily... and they have board games to play!!! Had a nice time."
0,"I've been to many pizzerias in my day, but I must say the one place where the taste of the food remains constant; no matter how many times you go is L&B's. It's a place where its cool to just come and chill out with your friends; over some amazing pizza. Of course, they only have a restaurant right next door to the pizzeria; but personally, I'd have to say they're known for that pies, and square pies at that. There's just something that sets it apart from other pizzerias; maybe its the sauce, maybe its something else, but whatever it is; I was extremely satisfied the first time I went and every-time thereafter."
1,I cannot wait to go back. It's like my eyes were opened to sushi.
0,WTF! I want some real pizza please. The crust was thin as air and my waiter had bad B.O.! Yuck. But who can be picky in Bushwick? Right?
1,"This was my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood, where most places are either extremely pricey (Nobu) or extremely cheap (any number of places). Brunch is a bit much because of the crowds, but I love Bubby's for lunch and dinner. The absolute best onion rings around and the pie is simply divine. The burgers are good and the mac and cheese is tasty as well. Order an entree that comes with sides and you will see the greatness of this place."
1,"The DP suggested coming here after we were told there would be a 45 min wait at Redhead. The name sounded familiar, but bells were not going off in my head (mainly because I was bushed from my 7 hour class and wasn't thinking properly). When we finally arrived - it all clicked and I remembered this place from way back in my undergrad years. Although I went to college in Queens, for some reason my friends and I used to find ourselves in this part of town quite a bit. And Cafe Orlin was our attempt at less student-like dining (at a reasonable price). I remember the first time I ate here, I had the tagine. When I came with the DP, there was no tagine on the menu, but there was a lot to choose from. I had a grilled kebab platter and he had the chicken schnitzel. I don't remember my meal too much because I was sleepy, but I ate all of it up. I remember ordering the espresso and ice-cream to wake me up and it was pretty good. All in all a solid place for a decent dinner, good service and a nice variety of menu options. I probably will end up here again. A-OK."

The warm goat cheese appetizer pretty much hit all the right spots. Atmosphere was romantic and the servers were actually friendly. I would definitely recommend this place! I'll be back for more cheese"
1,"Saw a lot of good reviews on yelp and decided to come here with my date for dinner. Unfortunately, my date was having some problem with his stomach so he only got a soup, which, according to him, was very delicious. (Winter soup) I ordered duck and waffle since it seemed super popular on yelp. It was a big chunk of fried duck meat on top of a non-traditional waffle. But I loved the waffle. This dish is like a combo of entree+dessert for me. The partially caramelized super buuttery cake-like waffle tasted great by itself and also went along with the savory duck. My only complaint is that it's difficult to cut the food nicely and eat it elegantly (but who cares lol). As much as I enjoyed the food at that time, I noticed that I was drinking water nonstop the whole night, so I guess the food was a little bit on the salty side. I also had a Sparkle and Shine per our waiter's recommendation. I like the multi-layer sensation of this cocktail and the subtle vanilla flavor from the vanilla bean."
1,"The food here is absolutely delicious and the pricing is not so bad either! I order the chicken sukiyaki which you get to cook at the table yourself on a cute mini stove top. With the meal I received 3 different vegetable sides, white rice, green tea and green tea ice cream. All this came include in the ""dinner"" price which was pretty good considering all you get. The green tea ice cream was absolutely amazing! Who would've thought? We also ordered edamame and the seafood egg dish for appetizer both were scrumptious. I find no issues with the food here whatsoever. By the time I left I was really full but it was a satisfying full where 8 didn't feel distrusting because the food overall was healthy, clean options. Staff is very friendly and place is very clean. Not too grand of a selection of drinks but you can definitely find something. Definitely a place I'd go back to."
0,"I came in with low expectations for this place. I left craving for more! Delicious food and great ambiance. Will come back again. Had the ""fish"" wrap and potatoes with the spicy mayo ( mind blowing)"
0,Raos is very old school and darn good red italian food. just happens to be in Harlem and the tables are few. There is a little bar where you can eat. Its really fun but if you dont have an in forget about weekends and most nights. Again you can hit the bar and eat.
1,"Ahh Artichoke. Yelp's hot boy! The big hitter! Seems like I'm the only person on here who hasn't reviewed this place. They even have a ""People Love us on Yelp"" sticker right on the counter! Here's my history with Artichoke. (About 5 months ago): I'm walking home from work. I see an insane line on 14th and I think ""When did a methadone clinic open up here? Oh shit that's an artichoke stand, aproprietly named 'Artichoke'. I mean, I like artichokes as much as the next guy, but Jesus!"" (A few days later): I walk by the same artichoke stand and there's the crazy line again. So I ask someone in line ""What's up with the line?"" The dude responds in a So-Cal surfer bro voice ""Man...You don't even know, this pizza is so sick! Totally worth the wait man."" I think ""Yeah, I bet."" So as I walk away, now fully understanding that it's a pizza place, not an artichoke stand, I start to contemplate whether I should check it out. (As the days turn into weeks) The line becomes more and more retarded and pizza eaters litter 14th street as far as the eye can see. (Three weeks ago) I start to notice that the hype is wearing down and long lines start looking smaller as the days progress. (Yesterday) My boo calls me as I'm walking home from work. ""I'm hungry!"" she says. ""Me too, Artichoke actually has no line, wanna try it?"" and she replies ""YES BITCH!"" So now this brings me to the moment.... the moment where I take my first epic bite of the Artichoke slice and........It's good! Waiting in line for 40 mins good? Not so much. Will I be back? Maybe if there's another short line, yeah I might."
1,It was a little bit of heaven. The food was amazing. Excellent octopus!  Bone Marrow was also absolutely decadent. Can't say enough good things about the food. The seating is definitely an issue - not the best place for a romantic evening of private conversation - but worth a visit!!!
