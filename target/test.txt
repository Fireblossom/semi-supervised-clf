0,"This is a tiny French place that has been in the village for ever. A timeless staple, if you will. I was told its been around for more than for more than 15 years. The food is basic, good French and you won't be disappointed if that's what you are in the mood for. The real attraction is the quaint atmosphere reminiscent of the French Riviera, and a friendly non-stuffy staff. I recommend a visit outside of the usual dining hours, as there is not room for many, and you will wait for a while, especially for brunch."
0,"Today a couple friends and I decided to go to Grimaldi's. When I got there I was very skeptical and annoyed with the long line outside. But my friends talked me into standing in it because, ""It goes really quick."" and, ""It's the ""BEST"" pizza in New York"" Soooooo, we stood in the line (for 30 minutes) when we finally got inside, it was cramped and a bit uncomfortable but who am I to judge. Besides, it's the ""BEST"" pizza in New York, so I decided to grit and bare it. We started out with the Antipasto plate (and I really liked it). Okay so on to the pizza, it was really good. Was it the ""Best"" pizza in New York??? I am not sure. I mean what classifies it as the best? It was good but c'mon. The service was bad to say the least. Once you are in the door they try to get you out like a woman that's been in labor for 34 hours. I asked for water 40 times before I got it and my waiter seemed to be annoyed every time we asked for anything. I guess you should ask, ""Should I go?"" Well the answer, ""Yes!"" Grimaldi's is a staple in NY and I think that you should go just to say that you went, but please put your expectations in check. If you plan on having the ""Best"" pizza in New york, you may not find it here; and if you want the best service you also will miss it. But what you will find are interesting people to talk to in line, a cute little old man that will tell you are beautiful and good times with friends."
1,"I would give this place 4 1/2 stars because it is better than 4 but not quite 5. If you love Riesling, this is definitely the place to go. I don't think I have ever seen a Riesling list this long! There are still plenty of other varietals in red and white, so if you are not partial to Riesling don't worry - there will be something for you. They really do have a great happy hour but it is exactly an hour, which makes me not as happy. The menu has a reasonable selection of noshes. I wish their red wines by the glass weren't served quite as warm as they were. The atmosphere is comfortable, with knowledgable and friendly staff. The crowd seemed to be professionals without being ""suits"" and the music was good. It is a little off the beaten path but worth a trip for sure."
0,The three different guacs were amazing! Small portioned- a bit pricey. Definitely great for celebrations.
0,"The closest thing to the perfect pizza. Fun place to eat at, indoors or out (if you can grab a spot), though delivery is insanely quick.  Fresh ingredients and the wonders of the wood oven may cause addiction to this place."
0,"Best brunch in the East Village, have been there a few times and everything I've had is amazing, especially the slow cooked scrambled eggs, yummo!! And the local food they have available for sale is also amazing, especially the local dairy.  Highly recommend it, can't go wrong!"
0,i really liked the place.... i went there with my friends the other day and we had bunch of stuff....we shared everything.. the food was great...  they can probably work a little on the wine list but considering that they just opened i assume that that is still in works I will for sure  go back soon..
0,Fantastic! I came in here about 2 weeks ago with my husband and the food and atmosphere were terrific. I recommend this lovely little spot for the Italian lover in all of us!
1,"I really like places like this, they have a unique menu with great choices! You can either get one of their signature chicken fingers, or get plain ones and choose your dipping sauces. Although the signature ones can be kind of pricey, (Around 4$ for 1), I like to get at least one cause they are pretty good! Especially the caramel pretzel one! The dipping sauces they have are excellent, they have a pretty large selection, and the sides are great too! I definitely recommend this place to chicken finger lovers!"
1,"Ivy is super close to my job, so I end up here with friends a lot.  The food is usually really good.  The menu is little, but I haven't had something that I haven't liked.  The fried calamari in the peanut sauce is incredible - definitely one of the best I've had.  the service is always good, but the prices are pretty expensive.  It's a really nice bar for the area though, since there is not a lot of chill places in that part of Midtown West."
1,"ate here on saturday, early evening with 6 of us all together.  i'd had dinner already at the e. village location, but came out to w'burg to check out the rum selection.  no one was disappointed.   food, service and drinks were very tasty.  i tried two different rum punches (tamarind and guava) and both were tasty.  i also had a rum drink that had coconut in it that was really good as well.  my friend, the rum know-it-all, was overjoyed at the rum selection and everyone loved their food.  we drank quite a bit, had a few appetizers and a few arepas each, and it came out to be $40/person.  not bad for the amount of food and drinks we consumed."
1,"Bring lots of friends and feast on family-style Italian food here because it's FUN duh. We got the calamari, the penne vodka, and the TITANIC for dessert, which was actually way too much food for the 6 of us. The food itself was just okay, not amazing, but I just really like the bustling atmosphere."
0,delicious!
1,"Loved this quaint little nook. A small, beautifully lit 12 person eatery, offering healthy, local and fresh Japanese set lunch. I'll be back next weekend, and the next, and the next. Especially loved the handmade pottery and the colorful plating!"
1,"Went to NPF last night. I would have given Northern Spy Food a better review should I not have caught the waitress rolling her eyes for her male colleague to witness when they delivered the food to our table and my friend asked for bread with her soup. You replied that you didn't have any, rolled your eyes at her and walked away. We left you at 25 percent tip as a reminder that just because we didn't spend a ton of money, it doesn't mean that we're cheap and hopefully next time you'll be a bit more respectful of your customers and the fact that their patronage is the reason you have this gig."
1,i must say ... this place is way overhyped ... with that said ... it's still great ... nothing amazing ... but it's ramen is very good ... so if you can bear the wait ... along with the foodies ... you won't be disappointed ... enjoy :)
0,The best pizza in the city..
0,"Very cheap and super tasty! 6bucks gets you a huge plate of rice, veggies, and gyro or chicken with white sauce/hot sauce on the side for you to apply just the right amount. The hot sauce is like the hottest thing I've tasted and Ive eaten peppers off of a trees. Right now they just have a cart on 2nd and 14th, NE side of the street but it looks like they'll have a store soon so WATCH OUT! It was so much food I ended up carrying it home. *burp!"
0,Very good middle-eastern food here.  The staff is friendly and the environment is lovely.  I have some celebrity friends that frequent this place and took me here my first day in NYC.  Eat Here!!!  You won't regret it!
1,"This place is really worth waiting! Once seated we were served very quickly and the food was just fantastic! we had the chance to sit at the counter and to be able to observe all the life happening on the other side, with the cooks preparing food as if they were putting together very delicate pieces of a nuclear bomb. fantastic experience!!"
1,"I have come here many times, and have the exact same experience everytime, extremely poor and barely respectful service, and a 30 min wait to get a sandwich, which arent bad, but I cant wait for someone to open another sandwich shop in the hood."
0,"Don't go here at dinnertime if you want to have a conversation, its very crowded and extremely noisy. The food doesn't matter if you can't enjoy the company you are with."
1,"Great pizza, amazing service, nice atmosphere. What would make it better? BEER! If you come alone (like I did) skip the line and head to the bar."
0,"Disappointed. To sum up how my first experience at Bustan resonated. My friends and I went to Bustan with high hopes to celebrate a birthday. Upon calling early in the week to make a reservation we were given the option of a late meal (1030) inside for our group or an earlier setting at 830 in their outside ""heated"" tent. Let this be a warning to you to not be fooled when they say the ""garden seating is lovely"" or that ""you will love it and it is warm."" The disgruntled faces wrapped in layers from every patron in the ""garden tent"" should have been enough warning to have us turn around. Instead, upon seating at the table you realize they place mega heating lamps that are so bright you will ask to change places with the person across the table- lest you get too tan on one side. Wouldn't want people to assume to went to the Bahamas over night. Further, the tent is quite drafty and said frigid air does wonders on the metal and heavily lacquered wooden ice cube...errrr benches. Fully clothed in a winter parkas, members of our table were shivering enough that the waiter offered us shots of tequila on the house to warm us up. Additionally they had scarves to help us stay warm (though they were the thinly veiled kind that you can buy 2 for $5 or 5 for $10 on the street and effectively did nothing to help the cold). Our table chose to order a number of appetizers and entrees and share all of the dishes ""family style."" The fragmented delivery of the food and often cold dishes served as a stark reminder that they most likely had forgotten us and didn't account for the fact that they would have to carry the food out into the cold space between the restaurant and tent. After starting some of the appetizers, we realized that they had forgotten 6 of the appetizers that had been ordered. Scrambling, they cleared the table and we had to wait an additional 35 minutes before any food appeared again. I would also add that nothing was done during the wait including a failure to refill water, ask if we wanted additional cocktails or wine, or bread. One of the members of our group seemed as though she could get up at any moment and leave. The food itself had the potential but the execution was poor. Presentation was lackluster and each dish was so close to being good but the sum of its parts hardly resulted in anything necessitating more than an initial taste. Thank god that after everything was finally served we reminded our waited of additional items that had not been served. Those last minute scrambles were the only items that came out warm and tasted fresh. I am glad for the company at the table. We considered the experience to be an adventure and turned to the person whose birthday was being celebrated and all decided to ""re-do"" the birthday dinner the next night. Oh, and for this being a birthday meal- they never asked if we wanted dessert or a candle (despite being told it was a birthday). Maybe the waiter could tell we were so cold that we needed to get out. What I find sad is that we all wanted to like this place. Perhaps if we were warm we would be more tolerable. But the cold compounded with horrible service and bland food makes this an experience we hope to forget soon. Too bad the check will remind us of just how much bad service can cost in New York City."
0,Hubby and I stumbled across this place while looking for somewhere to get lunch. Discovered that they have happy hour ALL day on Monday...SWEET!!! One word...The SANGRITA. This mix of sangria and margarita was sooo good! We tried the lunch special lentil soup for app and chicken empanada. Was bummed about the fish tacos since they are catfish and I don't eat catfish. Customer service was excellent. Def going back!
0,"I love their white slice, I could eat an entire pie by myself!"
0,"Service is a first class Good is first class Ambiance is a first class A new cute Thai restaurant in Hell's Kitchen,  I can't think of anything else to say but this is the best thai restaurant I have eaten! I normally don't like pad Thai but the pad Thai here is something that I can eat and finish the whole serving, and speaking of serving it's a lot haha! Definite a highly recommended"
1,"Great food, reasonable prices, kind service!   Pretty casual atmosphere but the food is fancier than the usual diner fare. The market sides are really nice choices for side dishes and beyond the norm of fries and a few veg. I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area!"
0,"Every time I return, I am amazed at how good the service and the food is! You most likely will have to wait a long time for a table, unless you make reservations days in advance, but it is always worth the wait. Love the food, love the staff, love the location!"
1,"Easter brunch at it's finest......Homemade donuts for appetizer, meatloaf sandwich for entree, ""pain killer"" cocktail with entree, and maple cream creme brulee.  Delicious all around.   The only downer was the server was pretty unhappy for working on Easter it seemed.  Food alone, this place rocks!"
0,"Sometimes you never want to leave your neighborhood to eat, but this is totally worth it. The wine, the food, everything is great. The wine is really unexpected and distinct. The baked clams are off the hook."
0,"Cramped, loud, and a bit of a wait on a Friday night.. buuuut, once we sat down, I was digging the vibe. Great mojitos, friendly service and reasonably priced dishes. Recommendation: Ropa vieja... delish!"
0,been going here for years always great and my go to except when the line is long
0,"Gandhi catered a meeting I had at Downstate and the food was amazing.  The owners and staff are wonderful, and very attentive.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Thanks a lot!"
0,"WOW The Burger is Delicious!!! My friend introduce me to this place I came all the way from Manhattan to try this amazing spot. Great place and atmosphere, way better than shack shack burger. Top food for your $. Will defiantly come back again(many times)"
1,"Bring me back to Rome! I don't drink coffee much but the paninis are to die for!!! And the cute little yoga juices, made me sooo nostalgic. Very friendly (but not annoyingly friendly staff). He must have noticed how much I was sweating so he gave me a glass of water, love it!"
1,"The food is fantastic, but I've been twice and the service is always sub-par. Both times, I watched my beer sit on the bar for about five minutes before it was brought over, and both times I considered pulling a Larry David and just going to get it myself. Same deal with the burgers - they're delicious, but it always takes way longer than it should for them to appear at my table."
1,French Fry heaven.. seriously.  small spot but doesn't matter once you shovel the fries in ur mouth and dip them into the many sauces they over.  I really have a scary obsession with french fries.. thank you pomme frites
1,Love the Shakes!! Hate the line :-(
1,"If you're on the loooong line, do the NYer thing and go across 6th Ave where there's a similar looking cart (or two) and a line waaay smaller. They're the same cart - and this one usually makes the food to sustain the ""main line."" They even have carts on 7th Ave now. When coming in the warmer months, be weary of the white sauce. While it is delicious and a must have on your mixed plate over rice - ANYTHING yogurt based should not be allowed to vegetate all day beside the heat of the main grill. It's what the food-safety experts refer to as ""potentially hazardous.""  Trust me, your bowels will be thankful for this tip later. Other than that! Bring your drunken self over and F E A S T."
1,"Just wait till you try the REAL thing was all they kept telling me as I tried to enjoy the good-but-not-amazing wanna-be-chicken-n-rices from other lesser Halal carts. But really, could it be THAT different, let alone THAT much better? And they were right. This cart compared to the others are pretty much worlds apart. Possibly galaxies. Usually, the munchies kicking in at 4am makes things taste a good 50% better, but no amount of munchies could have made this chicken-n-rice taste any worse than the deliciousness that it was. The line is crazy long, especially around 3-4am (and I'm sure at other times), but it's worth the wait and it goes pretty fast. There's actually another cart on the same corner who's line isn't as long but they're the same thing!! So if you want to not wait in line, look for that one. Chicken and rice is so tasty, and make sure you get the special white sauce, in which you must dump + mix into the chicken and rice before consumption. The red sauce is HELLS spicy so be careful! Don't get it mixed up with the other reddish BBQ sauce. Those sauces can getcha.. I craved this for a good 2 weeks after having it that night. If only I could get it delivered to Texas."
1,"I went to Scratch Bread for the first time this weekend, looking forward to trying the breakfast sandwich. But they didn't have that available, so I settled for grits with an egg and jalapeno and some sort of rice/toast/eggplant/egg dish that was on the brunch menu. Both were delicious, but the grits were the real standout--spicy and creamy, just wonderful! For a takeout restaurant though, they really need to work on their to go containers. They kind of wrap everything (be it grits or bread) in wax paper, and then put that in these flimsy cardboard boxes with no tops. I biked there, and I spent the entire ride home hoping that bouncing over potholes wouldn't ruin my breakfast."
1,"Great atmosphere - it is kind of dark inside, like an old speakeasy.  Dressy downtown crowd.  The food is bistro-like, i.e. steak tartare, stuffed pork loin, cheese plate.  Good wine selection.  It was fun for dinner, but the food wasn't fantastic and it is a bit pricey.  It gets crowded, so make reservations.  The coolest part of the restaurant is the fortune teller who sits in the very front - we didn't go, but I'm definitely curious."
1,"Fantastic sweetbreads!  Wow! And despite a wait, the bar was a great hangout.  Fantastic porkbun snacks as well as their seasonal pickle plate.  Great service, amazing food, fantastic drinks - fantastico!"
0,"Been to Freeman's many times before. Last two times though, including tonight, were terrible. Generally speaking, the food is good, but the service here is a complete joke. The staff simply doesn't care. Last two times I was here, it took 30 minutes for waiter to take drink orders, 1 hr 15 minutes to get first course, and main course took over 2 hours to arrive. On my visit tonight, we waited over two hours for dinner, only for the manager to walk over and tell us the kitchen was backed up...it was already 11:30pm when this happened. Then my dinner came out looking like it was thrown together by a trainee and was undercooked to the point of not being edible. By this point in the night, our waitress had disappeared and we were passed off to a new waiter. After the joke of a meal they made us sit through, they had the nerve to offer us free cheesecake to make up for the slow service, then tried to charge us the stated 20% gratuity for  parties of six or more (did I mention the 20% tip was huge because of how big our liquor bill had become while we were waiting for our food?). Bottom line, this place used to be awesome when they understood that customers come first...now they are so well known that they think they don't have to earn your business...like customers should feel privileged to eat there. I don't mind when a restaurant screws up, but when they don't own up to it...give me a break! Don't waste your time and $$ here...there are soooo many other places in NY (and the lower east side) that have equally good food and a staff that  actually gives two hoots if you go home happy."
1,"This is my go-to spot in Astoria for drinks.  They have a great selection of beer and their cocktails are crafted to perfection.  If you stay long enough, the bartenders often comp with free shots or free round of beers. There isn't much food to select from, but their burger is delicious.  Mac 'n cheese is great and their fried pickles are awesome (made from Brooklyn's own McClures).  Nice spicy kick to them. Ambiance of the place is cool and the interior has a great feel to it.  Place can get pretty crowded on Friday/Saturday nights"
0,"Absolutely delicious meal, wonderful service, casual cool atmosphere.  A must try!!"
1,"I was really disappointed in this place. I went after reading all the rave yelp reviews and unfortunately the hype did not match my expectations. Perhaps I got the wrong sandwich?  I got the Lamazou favorite and I found the proscuitto way too salty (I know that this is normally a salty meat, I've had it both in Italy and here in NYC). The bread was too hard also, made soggy by a too-sour dressing and flavorless mozeralla. I really wish I could have had a more enjoyable experience, maybe I'll give it another try someday."
1,"Reliable lunch/fuelling place/station...anytime of the day. Great food. Great prices. Great location/subway access. And given the set-up, extremely time efficient."
0,"I'd written a negative review about Almond before. First, my review was filtered. So I wrote an 'update' and it apparently went through. Long story short, had a solid meal there but service was not good. Management seemed to be aware of this but only reached out to part of our group to make amends, ignoring the rest of us. The owner reached out to me through yelp to directly apologize. I really appreciate that, it's great to see a business owner at a high volume restaurant who cares to reach out to individuals, and i'm confident that next time I'm there - on my next trip to New York -  the experience will be different. So, I'm now a fan of Almond. The food was good from the beginning, now I know they take pains to follow up and reach out to customers who aren't happy with service."
1,"This place is right on the money for quality, price, customer service and ambiance.  Their menu changes daily which is a nice treat than the same old thing every time you go. They use only the freshest of ingredients and most of their veggies are grown on the roof.  They offer a $27 price fixe dinner every night if you want to go that route. The tortillas are homemade with some of the best avocado it is perfect for an appetizer.  The skirt steak was tender with perfect flavor not to forget the grilled yucca to accompany the steak. For dessert they offered a short bread cake with fresh raspberries and blueberries that they got from the local green market.  It was the perfect way to end the dinner. I highly recommend trying Palo Santo.  Make a reservation b/c it definitely gets busy on the weekends."
0,I had the worst octopus appetizer at Scarpetta  last night.  Had the place not been chosen by dear friends who were treating us I would have sent it back.  The olive oil braised octopus was a mealy mushy mess - the chef should be embarrassed. I also had their signature tomato and basil spaghetti - which was ok but not worth going out of your way for.  The consistency of the sauce made me think of glorified spaghetti Os.   The staff was professional and attentive and the back dining room is nice enough - the huge skylight definitely adds something to the otherwise standard décor.
0,"I like the flushing one better. They always out of something (octopus, abalone, ect). Services is ok."
1,"Quite simply, the best tacos I've ever had.  It tastes better than in Mexico.  You can literally taste all the hardwork and love in receiving something so authentic so far from home."
1,Over rated serving size wasn't as big as some of the images lead you to believe since more than 1/2 of the platter was made up of lettuce. The chicken was dry (I was told i didn't put enough white sauce) but I was there for the chicken not the sauce. Worth the wait? Heck no.
0,"There were a couple reviews mentioning the really bad service and the expensive price for the less-than-competent staff and not-so-great food. There is no reason to expect as much as some of these people have expected from Petite Crevette. This is obviously not a restaurant like with Le Bernardin or Le Cirque. What you CAN expect is heartwarming charm, great seafood for an absolutely unbeatable price. There is no room for snotty, over-the-top, irrational personalities in Brooklyn. I regularly come to eat at Petite Crevette and have done so for at least 10 times now and i can attest that it is a humble and romantic place to have dinner. You can even stop by for a quick lunch. Some of the highlights for dinner (or even lunch for that matter) i can highly recommend are the perfectly seared sea Scallops with their amicably creamy and mustardy Dijonaise sauce, the classic Cioppino (similar to the Bouillabaisse) with its succulent lobster and seafood tomato broth, and the grilled Branzino (although the other whole fish are amazing, depending on your preference). The appetizers i absolutely love (and hear others recommend) are the amazing fried oysters with wasabi mayo and dijonaise mustard, the amazingly rich-tasting, deep red Heirloom tomato and fresh mozzarella over mixed green salad, and the seafood chowder with chunks of cod fish and just the right amount of carrots and zucchini. Like I said. This is not a 5 star restaurant so please don't go to Petite Crevette thinking you will be absolutely flabbergasted by the service. The staff is very friendly and you will not be disappointed. It is a humble place and you will feel at home. The food is absolute greatness! Chef Neil Ganic really knows his seafood, and his souschefs seem well trained to transcend his abilities and give you exactly what the last diner has received: absolute bliss! PROS: Homey atmosphere, great for couples, Amazing food, inexpensive CONS: not extremely easy to find, CASH ONLY"
1,The pork belly viet sandwich is out of this world! The kimchi fries are delicious as well. I can't get enough of either.
1,"The duck was excellent ! I really had a delightful dinner, full of savors. The place is warm, a bit rustic and noisy. Toilets are cute and comfortable"
1,"Was here slightly past half-12 on a Sunday. There was quite an insane crowd of people waiting outside of the cafe. Was told that the wait would take around 30 minutes - but within 10 minutes, my friend and I were seated! which was YAY as we were both starving. I ordered its Eggs Benedict - it was 3.5 stars - but the house fries was amazing! the baked skin was crispy and salty! We shared a portion of their legendary pumpkin pancakes. They were all right as well ... not too impressive. Service was average as well."
1,"I love anything Mario Batali. We tried this restuarant when we were in manhattan and this place did not dissappoint. We had the grilled octupus and tounge. I can't remember what other entree but for the price and quality, I will be back!"
0,"I went to Osteria Morini last night! I was SO excited to try this place out! I will start off by saying that the food was delicious...the meats melted in my mouth and the gorgonzola dolce, which is my favorite cheese, was also smooth and rich! The portions were decent as well...we got the Fried Appetizer (on menu under cheeses) for one person. This was also tasty but a somewhat strange arrangement of appetizers on one plate! We got the pasta with cream and smoked prosciutto (your typical pasta carbonara but w homemade noodle pasta). The serving size was a LITTLE too small for $18.00 but very fresh and good, none the less. I got the ravioli w marscapone and truffle butter! Good portion, smaller version of ravioli, and creamy! mmm! Again, for $19 (due to the truffle butter I assume) I think the price couldve been a fewww dollars cheaper! Especially when you look at true italian pasta dishes in Italy...they are decent portions but on the smaller side and quite cheap since they are served as a course in between many other courses. Over all, great food, GORGOUS AMBIENCE, and friendly staff.. there were a few confusions with our simple three meat platter, water's were not filled very often, no knives on the table and the service was just so-so. I am sure with a few more weeks this place will be flawless!"
1,"Excellent meal on all fronts. 3 courses for 86 dollars. For the first course, we had lamb pappardelle which was really tasty with a light buttery cream sauce and maine crab with a zesty lemon sauce. Our second course was a rack of pork with a caulflower sauce which was perfectly tender and a crispy duck dish that was uniquely flavorful and organic. We had a nice bottle of pinot nior from Caifornia (my fave!) that was berry sweet and complimented the meal nicely. For dessert, a delightfully warm chocolate bread pudding and cheesecake that put us over the top. Service was superb, knowledgeable staff and all around great experience. A classic establishment and worth the dime."
1,"i am a fan. great ambiance, food, drinks... i will be back. can't tell it was that big from the outside though."
1,"This place probably offered me one of the most unique and interesting flavors I've ever tasted. Although the place is small, it creates a nice, cozy atmosphere which I feel like is perfect for when you want to relax and enjoy the delicious foods from the creative mind of Chef Park. He incorporates the French and Korean taste so well! It felt like I was eating something new but also familiar at the same time! I'm from New Jersey and it took 2 hours to get here but I think it was totally worth it and if there are any other New Jersey-ans out there, I really recommend coming to Bistro Petit. Also, Chef Park will sit down with you and ask you about his food and just talk to you about his experiences as a chef. He's a really cool person! P.S. Try the Sea bass :D"

0,"one of my favorite pizza places, great pizza. be prepared though always a line to get in, which I guess should mean something ( GREAT FOOD).  Pizza always fresh, comes super fast and taste delicious!"
1,"Obviously came here for the pie, but i did have the Chicken Taco plate for dinner, which was actually quite filling. The organic peanut butter chocolate pie was smooth, hardy, and delicious. A must for any pie lover who likes their peanut butter... I was fortunate enough to have the lady friend buy the whole pie for myself.  It lasted about 2 weeks in the refrigerator, and I probably gained around 2 lbs after that. Even if it wasn't as smooth as it was from day 1, it was still damn good."
0,This food truck just parked right outside my building! It is delicious! I highly recommend the beef!
1,"Another hole in the wall,  very small cramped 6 tables a little dirty.   There are 2 types of noodles served here, hand pulled  or knife cut.  Knife cut is obviously cut with a knife and has more unevenness which gives more bite/texture.  Some people love it but for me not my favorite so I usually go with the hand pulled.  The soups are mild and sometimes mild is good.  This is a good mild soup great for the morning after a fun filled night.  Prices are fair, you get a lot of noodle but not so much/not enough meat.   The pot stickers were fried poorly, oil wasn't hot enough when they put it in so it wasn't crispy just oily.  I noticed not only my dish was messed up, everyone else who ordered it had the same oily dumplings.   If you want to try the dumplings I HIGHLY suggest to have them boiled instead. All in all, not a place that I will be day dreaming about at work but def. a solid bowl of noodles in Chinatown. FYI - They do have menu's in English.  My waiter didn't understand Cantonese or Mandarin and his English was very limited so don't expect to be able to ask about the menu unless you speak Fujian."
0,"Went to Marc Forgione last night and i LOVED it. I love restaurants and rely on yelp-ers to guide me in the right direction. But this is the first restaurant that compelled me to write a review. The place is a really good size 1/3 dedicated to the bar area and the rest to the dining + outdoor seating. The place is nice, comfortable & well designed; love the wood & openness of the space. I started at the bar with a white sangria with blackberries & raspberries - refreshing and not too sweet. Then moved to a table and our waitress was attentive but not overbearing and very friendly. I ordered the bacon wrapped pork chop with   onions and a potato puree (with a bit of wasabi). AH-MAZING; meat was cooked perfectly and the onions gave it a delicious accent flavor. My date had the steak with red wine & peppercorn sauce - the sauce was the perfect compliment to the steak. Again perfectly cooked flavorful and so delicious.  For dessert I had the ""peaches & cream"" which was sort of a deconstructed peach tart - not so great.  But the banana dessert was really good! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place. LOVED it and I can't wait to try it again."
0,I thought it will be better. The grill meats are a little hard and they don't add any spices to them. Pasta and other dishes on the buffet are much better than the grilled food.
0,"When I found out a Bahn Mi joint opened up in my neighborhood I was ecstatic!  There are no good Vietnamese sandwich places in Queens and when I get my Bahn Mi cravings (which is often) I have to travel all the way to Brooklyn.  I am happy to report, Joju's does not disappoint!  I've had the Bahn Mi at Pho Bac and other places in Queens, but their choices are limited and the sandwiches do not taste fresh and must be taken To-Go.   FOOD: I had the Grilled Pork chop and also the BBQ Pork sandwiches with spicy mayo.  They were really good - I loved the warm crusty bread (can be chewy at other Bahn Mi places) and the meat was very flavorful but not too salty.  I wish they put a little more meat because it was so yummy, but for less than $5 a sandwich, what would you expect?  The spicy mayo was great but not too spicy.  However, you can add your own amount of Sriracha sauce available on the tables there if you like it super spicy.  My friend had the Grilled Lemongrass Chicken Bahn Mi and said that it was yummy and the meat was very tender and juicy.  I will have to go back another time to try the Bulgogi Kimchi Bahan Mi.  Since I'm trying to cut down my sugar-intake I had the cold jasmine Green tea - not too sweet yet flavorful and healthy.  It was ok.....but I was eyeing my friend's Iced Vietnamese Coffee with Mocha and whipped cream the whole time.... SERVICE:  The service was great when I arrived - there were not too many people yet.  I had just beat the lunchtime rush.  When it did get busy, there were a lot of people waiting but no one seemed to really mind since it was so hot outside.  My advice is if you don't want to wait 10min or if you're ordering a lot of sandwiches - call it in beforehand.  The staff there is super friendly and really tries to cater to your needs.   AMBIENCE:  Very chill, minimalist atmosphere and very clean and new.  The bathroom was surprisingly really nice.  I think they had around 4 or 5 tables there. Overall, I enjoyed my food experience at Joju's and will be going back soon when my next Bahn Mi craving hits and will update my review...."
0,Love Love Love. Everything was amazing!!!!!!
1,"The chicken stix, veggie crisps, lentil salad and Greek fries were amazing. Paired with a red Sangria and finished off with kataifi made for the most amazing meal ever."
1,"My wife and I were in the neighborhood and decided to stop in ""America's First Pizzeria."" (They make that abundantly clear) The San Gennaro Festival was in full swing, so the mobs of tourists were also out and about. But Lombardi's seemed fairly welcoming, and the line was only 10 minutes. The host at the door seemed far more interested in texting whoever he was texting. But we shrugged it off. We were then taken downstairs to our table, in the corner, in the basement. We both laughed at how the setting was certainly not what we had expected, and a far cry from the nicer tables upstairs, with windows open and looking out to Spring Street. Downstairs, we may as well have been at the corner pizza joint you hit at 3am after a big night out. Old laminate floors, wobbly chairs, etc. TIP: Do NOT sit downstairs in the basement. It's depressing. We ordered a salad, the meatballs and a small pizza. I'm convinced the salad was made at 10am and had been sitting under clingwrap in the fridge for the past 10 hours. It was fine, but I could have made a better one with little effort at home. The meatballs were again, fine. Hardly out of this world. I've had better from the takeaway spot at Fairway. The pizza was decent. My wife and I both agreed that we preferred Patsy's or John's on Bleecker. One or two pieces of the pie lacked any cheese. Then came the shocker. Maybe we were zoned out a bit after a long day, or maybe we were thinking, 'It's a pizza joint - how expensive could it be?' ... But then the check arrived. I was stunned. 2 beers, a mediocre salad, 2 meatballs and a SMALL pizza with two toppings. $80. So after tip, more than $90! (And CASH ONLY? Either they're living in 1945, or there's a nice little tax avoidance going on here - just saying) I've lived in New York for a decade, and also lived in Tokyo and Hong Kong, so I'm used to big city prices, but this was HIGHWAY ROBBERY. Next time we're in the area, we'll find a Famous Original Ray's - get the same setting - for about $60 less. Lesson learned."
1,"The wait was a little long, but totally worth it!! Love, love, love the pizza and happy hour! Definitely come on an evening when you are in no time crunch so you can simply enjoy!"
1,"The only downside of Royale is that it's a bit out of the way. If you're living in the area, you're probably already a fan, but if you're a burger connoisseur you'll appreciate the above average burgers. Royale has a nice laid back atmosphere with delicious burgers that are among the best in Manhattan. The drink specials were pretty good too. I had to try a Pork Slap since they had it there, but it was on par with a PBR. If you're hungry and in the area, it'd be a good idea to stop by; you won't be disappointed."
0,"The waitstaff here is the warmest and friendliest of any restaurant I've been to on the LES.  It's refreshing to go to a place that actually wants my business!   I actually went to the area to meet a friend for drinks but Zest was having a sushi tasting event, and we went in for dinner.  The food was fresh and the decor was relaxing.  We'll definitely be back!"

0,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at PRINT this year and it was amazing. I can't believe we haven't heard more about this hidden gem! It's 11th Avenue location is surely to blame for its place off the radar, but don't let the walk cause you to miss this one! The menu changes daily, so everything is fresh and the ingredients are obviously of the highest quality. I started with the calamari, which had the perfect balance of citrus to tenderize the squid without overpowering the flavor. My husband had the roasted carrot and yogurt salad, which was also very good. For the main course I had the Berkshire pork chop - it was amazingly tender and moist with a ton of flavor. It was topped with hazelnuts and vegetables and was as close to a perfect dish as I'll probably ever have. He had the coq au vin, which he also really liked. The ambiance is very soothing, trendy and clean. The restaurant is spacious enough that you feel comfortable and can have a conversation without screaming. The service is top-notch - friendly, prompt and subtle. Basically, PRINT is everything I've ever wanted in a restaurant."
0,"One of our favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.  The ambiance, food, wine list and service are all excellent. Our favorite dishes are the salmon, beet gnocchi and the mezzelune.  If you're eating late, stop by for the Super Pizza (with prosciutto and arugula) on the late night menu.  It can be a little crowded at prime times so be patient, but otherwise this is a fantastic dinner option in the Upper East Side."
1,"Michelin 2009 1 star restaurant Saturday 8/21, we made the reservation for my friend Sonya's bday.. it was a blast.. service: very attentive, chef  himself even came out couple times to make sure we are happy with our meals... food order: 5 courses tasting menu $76 complimentary appetizers: most amazing one is the ""BLT""- Stokes Farms Heirloom Tomato Salad, Crispy Pig Ears, Smoked Onion Remoulade 1st dish: Hiramasa Tartare, Avocado, Sechuan Buttons, Pinenuts, Saratoga Chips (chew on sechuan buttons before dine in Hiramasa Tartare, the numbly taste sensation is quite interesting) in btwn dish: lamb pasta (for a non-lamb eater, i finished the whole dish) 2nd course: chilly lobster (ahhh.. forgot what ingredient in it... it's very spicy but taste soo good) 3rd course: wild striped bass(another yumm) w deep fried bone chip 4rd course: signature steak (toward this course we were already full... took a bite and wrapped up the rest... it was a delicious lunch the next day :p) 5th the final dessert: i was a bit disappointed at first, cuz they only serve one cup of ""sundae"" for 2 of us to share.... OMG... turn  out, t was the most satisfying thing to end this meal... it's a mix combo of chocolate ice cream w both fried and chocolate coated banana... love it....."
1,"Perhaps it's not fair to judge a restaurant based on their takeout, but we were pretty disappointed. The mee goreng noodles were the only decent thing we got. The roti canai tasted like paper and the curry was way watered down. The sambal shrimp were gross- very fishy and not in a hot drag queen way. The nasi lemak was just ok. The Malaysian I had in Minnesota was better than Nyonya. C'mon NYC... That's pathetic to be outdone by Minneapolis. Ps, I've been to Malaysia 3 times, and Nyonya pales in comparison."
1,Fabulous burger!
0,"I was thrilled to learn that Luis Bollo was returning to NYC. I had eaten so many wonderful meals at his former restaurant, Meigas, and was saddened when it close and he left town. After eating at Salinas I wish he would have remained out of town. Although our waiter was quick to point out that he was in the restaurant the night we ate there, I'm sure he did not taste any of the food that was being prepared because it was awful and most of it was inedible. This is a pretentious place for show and not for food. If you have money to burn and don't care about the quality or taste of the food then you should pay them a visit. If you want some real Tapas in the neighborhood try Tia Pol or a bit further down in the West Village Caliou both of which produce consistently outstanding food."
1,"On a dismal Monday at 9pm I came here to celebrate my first birthday as an ""adult."" I was in need of some serious cheering up. This meatball shop, The Meatball Shop, contained the cure to my wrinkle-filled blues. What better way to re-discover one's inner child then with menus that you actually write on with magic marker? What fun! We didn't have any wait at this time, which I understand is rare for this place, so I recommend for parties of 2 people: Mondays at 9pm! My friend and I sampled a potpourri of different meatball varieties and sauce pairings: the veggie and the chicken fennel were my personal favorites. The classic beef has pancetta mixed in, this results in curiously chewy bites. The spicy pork was a bit dry. And the special for the day was a take on buffalo chicken wings. The main issue with doing this flavor in meatball form is that it inherently lacks the crunchy fried chicken outside - a major part of the pleasure of fried chicken. In terms of the sauces I sampled: the pesto was my favorite. So green, so fresh, so fragrant. They were pretty skimpy on the classic tomato and I wish this wasn't the case, because that might have been good too. I just can't tell! Maybe ask for extra sauce (If you like things a bit saucy like I do...) The same can actually be said for all of the sauces I sampled: Just not enough! Dessert really takes the cake though! They give you huge and I mean HUGE balls of iced cream. PLUS you can design your own iced cream sandwiches - I've basically forgotten how old I am at this point. We did chocolate chip + mint + brownie and gingersnap + caramel + snicker-doodle. Both were amazing, the mint was better. This is obviously a review for an off time, but the great part about this place is that they're open until either 4 or 2 am depending on the night. So if you're in need of a ball, or two, they're your men! PS Possible celebrity encounters might also be in store for you: We saw Penn Badgley of Gossip Girl fame. Not that I recognized him, so bring a hip friend who knows what famous people look like when you go ballin'."
1,"Stopped in for brunch, no one greeted us, (not even a hello) We found a table in the back, it was beautiful, the coi pond with the turtles and the whole environment of the back yard was awesome. Then we decided to order, it was a busy saturday morning and two people were working... two. The chef who was, taking orders, receiving money and expediting food was snarky and rude (which I get because he was weeded) and the bartender wasn't much help either. Why was the cook doing everything? When we got our food (after waiting for a really long time) my date's pancakes were cold and my hangtown oysterfry had multiple egg shells (yuck) in it and the oysters were slimy mush(vomit) also, I got toast... not buttered, no butter option or jam given... just plain dry toast. I also didn't get any silverware and when I asked he was again rude, why should I fear someone who is placed a position of customer service? Someone get this guy some help.  When we finished there was also no designated place to put the trays and trash, we looked. This place needs more staff, that was a terrible brunch experience minus my handsome date and the cool backyard."
0,"Amazing authentic Mexican food! Best Mole enchiladas, and best Tres Leches (second to mine)."
0,"I was looking forward to try authentic french food. Since French are known for being snob in eating, I expected to be blown away by 4.5 stars average from more than 500 yelper. However, the food is good but not as amazing as I expected from 4.5 star. 4/5 for overall experience and nice service. Food is good but not excellent. I was expected to be blown away by flavor and aroma by French cusine. My first French dining experience, my gf said it is better than others French restaurant she've been to. I guess I have to try other French restaurant to calibrate my expectation to the taste of French cusine to see if it is true 4.5. Order: pear w/ cheese for appertizer, lamb chop for main course."
1,"This place is such a hidden gem.  You walk in and think its a small little restaurant on the west side until they take you downstairs and it opens up to a huge seating area. I went with some of my girlfriends and got the Matador Combo...one word WOW!!  It was enough to feed us 4 and then some!! A whole chicken, rice and beans, salad with avocados and fries topped with sausage aka hot dogs!! I couldn't believe how much food it was for only $32!! All of the food barely fit on the table!! It was SO GOOD!! I wouldn't be me if I didn't try the sangria and boy I'm glad we did.  We polished off 2 pitchers and it had us nice and tipsy. This is a great and really affordable place to come with a group. Can't wait to go back!"
0,"Stopped by for a few appetizers and sangria with a friend on a Tuesday night. We found the food very blend, but enjoyed the atmosphere of the place and the sangria. Little overrated in my opinion,  especially food but I might give the lounge area another  try."
0,"My wife is 4 1/2 months pregnant, and the baby wants burgers.  As a result, I have been working towards trying every burger that can be delivered to Nolita. I do not feel compelled to write about pretty much any of the others, but the Bronte...the Bronte... A burger's all about how the beef is prepared, and at Ruby's the burger is seasoned majestically. Baby found his burger, and daddy did, too. P.S. I recommend delivery or take-out, because seating is at a premium. The place is a shoebox."
1,"I've been known to wait outside at 12:58pm (it opens at 1pm weekdays. Closed on Mondays); it's just THAT good. My first visit was met with a sweet fragrance in the air. Me: ""Ooooo. What's that smell?"" Owner: ""I'm making *strawberry jam. I just can't find a jam I like so I decided to make my own."" [Swoon.] And just like that I am a fan. And repeat customer. Each crepe is made to order (and the owner will happily substitute ingredients for your very own crepe creation). The savory crepes ooze crispy cheese and the sweet crepes call my name post-lunchtime. Refer to above. *PJ Sweet Crepe (peanut butter and her delicious homemade jam) Cash only. Lunch is easily just under $10 here for a savory crepe and drink. Small table in back and small side counter/wall table or dash off with a to-go bag of your deliciousness."
0,Not so bad...
0,"Never tried an arepa before, now I love them, you always find a very friendly host here, I recomend this place 100 percent"
1,I've come here twice for brunch and once for lunch. If you're coming here for Sunday Brunch you MUST make a reservation. The walk-in wait is 30mins to an hour sometimes more. Food & drink: I always go with the bottomless mimosa. Start off with the wings. Then go for the fried chicken and red velvet waffles. Now it's not the best chicken and waffles I've had...but it's pretty good. Would I go back? I damn sure would. Lol Would I recommend it? I have and I will continue doing it. Lol
1,Awesome veal ragu. For dessert get the chocolate cake.
1,"My friend and I went here for brunch. I dug (past tense of dig? hm) the set up of the restaurant, with the bar on one of the long sides and the window-walls along the front open for brunch if the weather's nice.  of the wall walls, which are solid, but in mellow tones. Drinks were okay--I think my friend had a frou frou version of a mimosa and I had a bellini. Standard brunch stuff. My friend had the red flannel hash (roasted beets, diced potatoes, bacon, scallions, poached egg), which sounded great, but if you actually imagine it--all those vegetable chunks + bacon + egg--is simply okay. The bacon was nice and chunky, though. Just how I like my bacon and monkeys. For some reason, I wanted the mac and cheese. I am on the hunt for a fantastically cheesy mac and cheese with just enough mac to serve as a vehicle to transport the cheese to my mouth. This had a moderately thick cheese coating--almost, but not quite it. Service was rather hands off, but, eh, it was brunch at 3 with very few people, so whatevs."
0,"Where was he?? Are they not open on sundays? I went and only saw the lonely menu hanging on the fence, darn Edit: So I went back the next day (monday) and there he was! Ordered the falafel sandwich with tahnia sauce and hot sauce, was very tasty and the pita was soft and fresh! Not better than my dads falafel in NC, but still absolutely fantastic! Thanks ahmo!!"
0,Great Burritos! Lines can get a little long(but move quickly) but can never get a seat.
0,"Regrettably this restaurant was a disappointment on many levels. The service was second class, the food was overcooked and the prices were outrageous. The wine list is wonderful but overpriced ( like everything else). I will not return"
0,"Homey. Delicious.  Healthy. What more could you want? I had the Garden Veggie Sandwich with tempeh and it was so yummy, my stomach is still singing with happiness. If you are in the area, stop by.  You will be so happy you did."
0,"Don't live near Little Owl anymore but still one of our favorite restaurants by far. The inside is adorable, service is a bit snooty but good, and the food is divine. Fancy comfort food. There is very little we do not like here. The gravy meatball sliders (the only food I like veal in anywhere), the bibb and beets salad, the risotto bianco with that egg yolk and truffle, the brussels sprouts-- all incredible. Always so hard to choose apps and sides for only two people! We love the famous pork chop, always cooked perfectly and so flavorful, and my husband raves about the fish. The best entree there, though, proves how good they are and that is because they have elevated chicken to such a heavenly level. Their crispy chicken dish is aptly named. The texture of the skin is perfect, the meat itself is impossibly juicy, and the seasoning is aggressive and bold. A must try. The only downsides here are that we were not impressed with our food the one time we went for lunch with a group of friends, which was surprising and disappointing, and the fact that whenever we wanted dinner here, we had to make a 5 pm reservation weeks or a month in advance if we didn't want to come in and wait for a table for over an hour. They do have a cute elevated bench for you to wait on, though, which overlooks the restaurant and makes for great people/food watching. Thank you, Little Owl, for countless wonderful dining experiences! We can't wait to return to our old home and visit you again."
1,"I've decided there are too many ""4-stars"" and not enough ""5-stars"" dedicated to Penelope. This place is my new neighborhood haunt.  I know what you're thinking: ""But you're from Chicago, you poser""   Well first, shut up and second, I live (more than?) half of my life in New York too and right by Penelope's, so there. I love this place.  Both the food and the staff make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Croissant egg sandwiches?  Delicious and perfect for greasing up my innards before a long day of shopping.   The shabby chic decor is charming and although it is another one of those places I could label as ""chick city,"" it's not overwhelming in the sense that if I brought my boyfriend he would feel the need to grow a beard and inject himself with a shot of testosterone shortly after. Plus, if it's good enough for Julia Roberts (gawker alert), it's good enough for me dammit!!"
0,"This is one of those rare places, that actually make you feel like you are eating an authentic food, straight from the source. Everything is so fresh and delicious, that i sometime wish i lived closer, or that they will open one next to my house. Their Falafel Sandwich is very good (sometime a bit oily), but the smell of the fresh spices, chopped vegetables and amazing Pita bread make it disappear. The only reason i took off one star, is due to a loud argument between one of the waiters and one of the guests. I think that the waiter/manager could easily take it to a different place, and not let all the customers feel a bit uncomfortable. Try it, unique experience!"
0,"Updated sound system, kitchen open til late, great djs, top quality!"
1,"One of the great misses of the week. I thought the first few courses we ordered were mediocre at best and not flavourful; the beef carpaccio, corn soup were actually quite bad. The pork croquette entree (very similar to the testa from Blue Hill) was delicious but not on the same level as Blue Hill - the beans underneath this dish were also quite good. I really would not recommend this restaurant based on the food we had that day. I assume this is probably an isolated incident but that's how it went. I also didn't like the feel of the restaurant - it seemed like somewhere I would take my parents for a dinner but never go by myself or with friends. It seemed that all the people dining there were either old or were visiting from out of town (no young locals = bad sign)."
0,Best restaurant service in Brooklyn. Great steaks and the banana bread pudding is amazing. There's really nothing bad on the menu...
1,"Really, really one of the best dinners I've ever had in Manhattan. I don't even know how I'm going to eat tomorrow after all the deliciousness inside my mouth tonight. Baked goat cheese tapas? So good our (AWESOME) waitress Meredith brought over more bread so I could lick the cheese bowl clean (I keep it classy). Squid vermicelli tapas? Artfully mixed at the table and tastes like the most heavenly noodle dish on Earth. HEAVEN. Now, let's talk entrees. The cod-octopus-clam-artichoke masterpiece needs to be tried by everyone in NYC. You're vegan? Doesn't matter- this is worth breaking your moral code for. And okay- the chef's recommendation, some pork-sausage-bean-pearl-onion fantasy? Fan-frggin-tastic. My foodie friend and I ate this dish in complete silence just ""taking it in"". Also- the second cocktail on the menu, Roja-something is legit the most interesting cocktail I've ever tried. It's super smoky tasting. If every restaurant in NYC were half as good as this one I would be 400 pounds. I love you, Salinas."
0,"It isn't very often that I will dive my face into a chicken, lick the bones, salivate while doing so, and shed a tear when the chicken is picked dry. But at Hu Kitchen, this behavior is what I exhibit each time I go. Their paleo-esque meals mixed with a sleek modern atmosphere is to die for. It can be a little pricy, but I am hesitating to demote their star ranking just for that alone. This is, after all, Manhattan, where it costs $20 just to fart in some parts of town. Must-haves include: rotisserie chicken, anything including cashew cream, Hu's chocolate bars, chia pudding, and turkey meatloaf. I hope this place continues to be successful as can be."
1,"this place be da bomb. . . i am here at least 3 days a week & for $7 you can't eat all they give you. . .  they have a menu but think HS cafeteria style. You walk in & look over all the deliciousness they have behind the glass & then you start to pile it on the plate. rice, beans, chicken, beef, pork, salad, veggies & if you dont see it they can make it. DUMBO is full of ""i just discovered Brooklyn"" transplants who love to pay way too much for stuff the locals know where to get for half what they trustifarians are paying. go here & eat."

1,"Thai girl on UES seeking Thai food. Finds Up. Takes parents. Parents raaaaave, Thai girl scores big. The end. Get: Grilled chicken plus sticky rice Minced chicken basil rice plus egg Crispy pork"
1,"Good food, but not super special.  Service was great and fast, but I only tested this around the 4pm time (service should be excellent during this time).  The food was very basic and our kebab plate was delivered lukewarm.  The falafel was not very flavorful, but we did love the dumpling special.  If you are hungry, the portions are large enough to fill you up, even if you missed a meal during the day.  I can't say definitely try this restaurant, but if you are in the area and hungry for Turkish food, then let me know what you think."
0,"WOW!  Noodles are fabulous.  Dumplings are perfect - thin skinned and a great contrast of soft and chewy/crispy.   The interior is SPARTAN but that's definitely part of why I like it.  There are three? mismatched tables and two counters.  It is silent inside, except for eating sounds, the loud banging of dough on the table, and once a man who kept burping.  Kind of unsettling and creepy but in the best possible way."
0,"Being from Miami, and visiting NY I can say that these are one of the worst empanadas I've had. Not authentic what so ever, and the service was terrible. Not worth waiting in line to try this place out"
1,"Oh, boy.  No reservations, and always a 2-3 hour wait?  Please...enough.  It ain't that great, nothing to write home about anyway. If you find yourself saying different, it's probably just because you're starving by the time you finally sit down.  Let's face it, if you're eating at 11:00 at night, and haven't eaten since lunch, a Ritz cracker would be fantastic too. I know it's a Mario Batalli place, and I like my man, Mario, but walking in at 7:30, and sitting at 10:30...come on.  The red headed fat man is not THAT wonderful.   One thing I will give credit for is that the pasta for the homemade lamb ravioli's was great.  You could tell there was some time put into that pasta....the lamb stuffing on the other hand, not so much.  Taste wise good, but bones in my $30.00 for 5  lamb ravioli dish?  Boo. Another thing that totally ""miffed"" me was the crap attitude our waitress had.  Asked for a wine recommendation, and she seemed annoyed.  I don't really know or understand why...I eat at 11:00 pm, and the waitress is annoyed, nice.  Staff seems pretentious and better than you are. This place is connected with Ino (a low key favorite restaurant of mine).  When a buddy of mine was sitting at the Ino bar one night, talking to a friend about how Lupa blows but Ino is awesome, the bartender overheard and totally agreed... No need to waste your whole night away, waiting for subpar food, and snotty service."
0,Stunning interior decor. Very friendly and welcoming waitstaff. Service is quite fast and on par. Very affordable menu. I tried the pho dish and ribs on sugar cane. The pho dish was different and unique from all other phos Ive had. It's actually worth a try. The ribs on sugar cane was a surprise. This place makes any food look sexy. And the taste...it was just simply heaven in my mouth. It gave me a hard-on. Overall the place is dope. Expectations surpassed. Got more than what I asked for.
1,"best sushi EVER! everything is just mind blowning! loove the sockeye salmon!  maybe opt out of the fatty tuna... it was good but not the best. also fantastic green tea ice cream! full of macha flavor, less on the cream; hence, light in the tummy-- just freakin' awesome!! highly recommend the dinner sets-- great value! seating at the sushi bar is a must!"
0,"I stopped by here for a quick beer with friends and it was fun. The inside of a garage that is done up in quirky decor, it is definitely a great idea. They even have an outside area in the summer.  The only downside is seating. The place gets crowded and seating is scarce. Especially if you're trying to grab a bit to eat."
1,"I finally checked this spot out thanks to my fellow yelper friend, Lex T who raves about this place.  I ordered three empanadas and they were all good. I had the Hawaianna (pineapple, pork and cheese),  sweet plantain and cheese and Chorizo and Potato. They were all good and affordable and the sauces that came with them were delicious. I had to wait awhile before they were done and plus it was crowded. The staff said its better to call in advance and just pick it up to avoid the wait. I will definitely return."
0,"The most unique and unexpected food I've ever had, and all amazing! Seriously, i had steak with Pomegranate... it was delicious. Along with the awesome beer line up, and whiskey/alcholol/mixed drinks selection. This place blew me away."
1,Came here as a backup because Malatesta was too crowded. Really liked the staff -- had good recommendations and was attentive. The veggie lasagna was tasty! So were the mussels -- flavorful and plentiful. Good wine selection.
1,"My fave cheap noodle spot! I have been coming here for years, thanks to my mom. We make it a tradition to have lunch here whenever we are around Chinatown or anytime we are in the mood (a lot of times. We are Asians and noodles are what we do) I usually order the same thing: wonton noodle soup (soup separate/on the side). Add some of their chilli sauce and I am in paradise. Can't beat their price either. I have tried Wonton Garden and their noodle soup is pretty good too. But there is something about the way Bo Ky makes their noodles and the chilli sauce that keep me coming back. I don't complain about service in this place because it is expected of most Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. They sound rude because that's just the way they are. They are abrupt and rough, but hey..it doesn't drain my wallet so I am good."
0,"I like the lamb sandwich, the spicy lamb, and the salad combo. Every once and awhile, they forget to put the salad stuff on the falafel, which is odd. The pizza takes a while and I'm usually in a hurry. The owner is always nice although he seems put upon and tired of the world. His eyes are tired. But night after night, he is pleasant and his staff seem to be happy to be there together, year after year. They are from Egypt and will chat about how things are going there -- not well. And you get some great food, fast, at great prices. Nice."
1,"Rabbithole is an excellent place to sit and have a coffee and scone - try the raspberry or apricot. The food is also amazing, eggs on a bagel with cream cheese is perfectly made, and I love the veggie burger! The interior is cozy and the garden out back is lovely. I would have rated this 5 stars, except.. the service is really really slow. To the point where every time I take friends to eat there, we end up waving our hands in the air or get up from our table to get the servers attention. It's worse at weekend brunch, when it's busy and completely understaffed. I truly do love this place, the food is superb, I just wish the service were better."
0,Thet have the best fries I ever had. The burger is awesome. The atmosphere is British pub meets the village. Bartenders are really good and they have a nice cask beer.

1,"OH MY GOODNESS. Thank god I came to the Chelsea Market today and had food from this place. The food that I ordered (carne asada quesadillas with everything in it, on corn tortillas) was so, so, SO delicious. I nearly cried after my first bite. It was THAT good! The meat was so flavorful, and everything was fresh. And I also loved that they actually make your food right in front of you. I guess my only ""negative"" comment about this is that their portions are small. Don't just order one item because it won't be enough. Trust me. Today was my first time here, but it definitely won't be the last. Please do yourselves a favor and try this place out. The line will be long but, man, it'll be so worth it."
1,"How does Ippudo make me grumpy, oh let me count the ways: 1) I hate waiting 45+ minutes for a bowl of noodles.  This is not the Cheesecake Factory. 2) In Japan you won't find a ramen shop that has 150 seats, 20+ servers, and an eight-page menu. 3) I hate waiting 45+ minutes for a bowl of noodles.  This is not a ride at Six Flags Great Adventure. 4) In all honesty, real ramen shops don't serve pork belly buns. 5) Did I mention that I hate waiting 45+ for a bowl of noodles?  People in Japan eat their noodles quickly and LEAVE, people!!! In the end, it doesn't matter.  I love their food.  I will wait in line like a starving lemming.  I will shamelessly eat pork belly sandwiches, no matter how unauthentic the experience.  I'm such a poseur."
1,"Every time I got to a place that W picks, I am not into it and we all were going to go to Flushing, but we ended up going to Brooklyn and F and W wanted to come here. They are regulars here and F probably wanted to come here because of the oysters. F got a dozen of oysters and the other dozen, W and I shared the appetizer. Their mignonette was just okay, the garlicy one didn't win me over, instead I just did cocktail sauce with extra horseradish. The other dark mignonette, couldn't really even tell with this one. W and F got their own Creamy Polenta - it was really good, but the sausage and the pool of sausage grease would not work well with me if I tried to eat this whole thing by myself. I can't stuff with too much oil, but if you can, this dish was really nice. Steak Tartare - I love a good steak tartare and I got this and unbeknownst to me, W and F do not eat raw meat. Okay, great, so I get to eat this dish by myself. But when this dish came out, I saw the greyness of the meat. It was not raw, it was like cooked a bit and the chopped of meat was not diced as fine as I would have preferred my tartare to be. It was really chunky and I wouldn't mind this if it tasted good, but this dish was a no go for me. I haven't had a bad steak tartare, not that I could recall, but this one has made the list. Grilled Octopus - eh, did nothing to my taste buds. I'll stick to Le Pescadeux braised octopus. Braised Short Ribs - again, not my favourite and for me it was just lackluster. Tiramisu - good and strong. You can taste liqueur. Bread Pudding - I want to say this dessert had a really nice surprise hidden inside. Chunks of chocolate and I am not a fan of chocolate, but this dessert actually won me over. It was really good and I do love bread pudding. Overall, I was not amazed by the food here and I judge this solely by if the food here did something to my taste buds and my taste buds didn't dance here. However, I do love the bread pudding and it I can handle it, I definitely would do the Creamy Polenta."
0,"I've come here in the past and absolutely loved it. Great atmosphere and wonderful food. The last time I dined here, the service was so awful!!!! We were seated late on a Saturday night as it was still packed. After about 35 minutes the majority of guest began to leave. Instead of making us feel comfortable, all of the workers started frantically cleaning the entire inside and outside including unhooking the plants from our table. Some of them were drinking coffee, smoking and overall hanging outside just waiting for us to finish. We were not offered coffee or desert. When it started to slightly rain I asked if they could open awning again, they suggested I finish my meal at the bar. When we looked inside, all of chairs were on the tables. We complained to our server in a very gracious manner and she said ""it's not my fault""! I am posting because I thought the owner would like to know and because I would like I warn everyone, get there early!!!!"
1,"I ate here almost three weeks ago and I still cannot stop thinking about it. I had the miso ramen with pork and a soft boiled egg and it was the best ramen I've had in NYC/Brooklyn so far (out of the 6 places I've tried). The side of garlic they serve with the soups was so good I could have eaten it on it's own, but poured on top of the meat, it was heavenly. The noodles were thinner than most ramen I've had, but we're still super filling and cooked perfectly. The meat was tender, but still fell apart in your mouth with a perfect texture to complement the noodles and flavorful broth. The only bad thing about Chuko is the wait (the restaurant is small and not suitable for large parties). But! They have a texting service to notify you when you're next on the waiting list, so you can grab a drink across the street while you wait. Chuko is cash only, but they have an ATM available in the back."
0,"Hell's Kitchen needed this bar! I would go here for happy hours with colleagues, a night out with friends, or a a few nice cocktails with my boyfriend. The space is beautiful. There are huge open windows that face 9th Avenue and 53rd Street, and it's all gorgeous wood inside and they've got candles everywhere. It's extremely comfortable to be inside with friends - there are long, high pub tables in the middle, low seating along the windows and a really nice bar. It manages to feel open yet cozy. Great beer selection - I was in for Happy Hour and began at the bar and couldn't believe I was getting such fancy beers for only $5. A ton of bourbons and a whisky-peach drink that I'll have to try next time. Seems likes it's a pretty great Happy Hour for what they're offering. We got to try some of the small plates: Beet and Goat Cheese Salad and the Pig in a Blanket. Order both. The Pig in a Blanket was a exactly perfect - sausage wrapped in phyllo dough served in slices with a yummy dipping sauce. Staff was really nice - the bartender Mark knew all about the beers and menu, handled a full bar yet still managed to chat with us, and was playing great music. The place filled up pretty quickly on a Friday afternoon, and we moved to a table as friends joined us and had equally wonderful service. Not pretentious, not a scene. Just a good vibe all around."
1,"I can't a believe a tiny little deli store in the east village has a really really really good sandwich. Thanks to Lisa D., my boyfriend and I after a late night of drinking in the east village, stopped by Sunny and Annie's which is a tiny little deli store that looks like a mini bodega. I can't begin to tell you how tiny this place is. I would have never thought this nondescript bodega on the corner has something awesome to try if it wasn't for Lisa D. It looks like any other bodega/deli/corner store. My boyfriend and I shared the Pho #1 on a hero. WOW. I don't know who Sunny and Annie is but, MAN, they are artists for reinterpreting the Vietnamese bowl of pho. Their sandwich, called Pho #1 is like a deconstructed pho in a sandwich. AWESOME. The sandwich had roast beef, bean sprouts, basil, onion, cilantro, avocado, tomato, hoisin sauce that is mixed with some Sriracha and can be served cold or hot...I had it cold and it was AWESOME! Please try!"
0,The guacamole is incredibleeeeee. I also really love the chicken fajitas.
0,"The real deal, the one you probably didn't come to on a tour bus, the one that still has people coming here who were born in Brooklyn.  That and delicious praise worthy square pie that you can't get anywhere else.  Come with friends on a warm summer day and order a full tray with hommade spumoni for desert.  Sit at the picnic tables in the parking lot and take it all in.  This is an original."
1,"This is some of the best Foie Gras food I've ever had. I love that the food is fresh, clean, and not too salty. The portions are large. Service is good, although I feel it could be better at times. The food came out timely and was good. I just wish I lived closer so I could be a regular. This place is a jewel and I will be eating here regularly. I would recommend!"
1,"First time at Bustan. Went there last week on a Thursday evening for dinner.  Everything seemed interesting so we ordered several plates and shared, mostly appetizers. Cute place, not much space but nice atmosphere. Food was greattttt! Loved the falafel and baked potatoe which was crunchy! Other than the main dish we ordered, food came out very fasttt! Service was okay, prices are ok... average a little on the pricier side but still good."
0,"Fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and hard-to-find dishes abound at this St. George restaurant, which boasts a roster of Italian grandmothers from different regions (currently: Naples, Campania, Abruzzo, Vicenza, Milan, Sicily and Calabria) rotating through the kitchen and cooking up their family recipes. (There's also an encyclopedic wine list with bottles from small Italian vineyards that are otherwise hard to come by in NYC.) On to our meal: INSALATA DI PERA E GORGONZOLA (MIXED GREEN WITH PEARS, GORGONZOLA CHEESE AND BALSAMIC REDUCTION): This salad perfectly married the tangy balsamic dressing with sweet pear and amazingly fresh, creamy gorgonzola. BURRATA CON CILIEGINO: This dish combined burrata cheese (mozzarella with a creamy liquid center) imported from Puglia with sliced cherry tomatoes, olive oil and fresh basil. The tomatoes were extremely fresh--crunchy and sweet. The burrata was soft and creamy, though it could have used more salt to draw out its flavor. POLPETTE (HOMEMADE BEEF-PORK MEATBALLS IN TOMATO SAUCE): These were garlicky and tender, bathed in a light tomato sauce seasoned with garlic and basil. The meat eaters in our group, who are not huge meatball fans, were blown away. The recipe, we later learned, came from that day's nonna--chef Teresa Scalici, who hails from Agrigento, Sicily. CARCIOFI ALLA GRILIA (GRILLED ARTICHOKES): These were superb. First marinated in garlic, olive oil and balsamic vinegar and then grilled, the artichokes were crispy and slightly charred outside but perfectly tender, with a tangy flavor and a garlicky-smoky edge. The only drawback: The fibrous leaves were difficult to chew. The recipe, which comes from Calabria, is one of owner Jody Scaravella's favorites and has been on the spuntino (small plates) menu since Enoteca Maria opened. PIZZA MARGHERITA: In comparison to the light, flavorful dishes that preceded it, the pizza margherita, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil, was heavy, with muted, unremarkable flavors. The ingredients--fresh mozzarella and basil, as well as house-made tomato sauce and dough--were clearly not the problem. Rather, the proportions and execution were to blame. The thick layer of melted mozzarella overwhelmed the tomato sauce, and the dough, though distinctly flavorful, was undercooked. THE TAKEAWAY: There were a few misses in our meal but many more hits, and we left impressed by Enoteca Maria's innovative, multiregional concept--and even more so by the eatery's authentic Italian home cooking executed with an elegant, light touch."
1,"Mighty Quinn's occupies the space that Vandaag used to be in. I realized this as I was having my very delicious dinner here along with a friend. Like most BBQ places it's self-serve cafeteria style. We ordered the brisket, ribs, and 3 sides along with pickles. The brisket was so tender and the ribs were full of flavor. You can't go wrong with either choice. As for the sides we both loved the bean salad and the baked beans with browned ends. Both were so good. We also had the yams but that was a little too sweet. All together our food cost $23 per person excluding beverages. Not bad at all since if I remember correctly Fette Sau is a bit more expensive. I've heard the lines get long but we were there when it was one of those freezing nights so we didn't have to wait at all. I'm glad Manhattan finally got its BBQ spot!"
1,"Delicious Japanese small plates. After reading a bunch of reviews my first visit to this restaurant was for lunch with a couple of work colleagues. Was disappointed to the core. The food was nothing great, and the hype and the relatively expensive tab labeled a serious no-no for this place However went here for dinner (31st night) and what a surprise. Its as if the restaurant was schizophrenic. Completely different menus. Had about 12 delicious small plates a bottle of Sake and 3 desserts between 5 of us which cost about 60$ per person. Excellent. Recommendations: Roasted duck, Slices raw squid, Deep fried shrimp rolls, Beef tongue, Spicy Cod fish roe A must try if you are in the mood to share"
1,"I'm writing this review as someone who accidentally ate someone else's leftovers in the fridge from Artichoke Basille's Pizza and got yelled at when they realized it went missing. All I have to say is even when cold and chilled overnight, the artichoke pizza is pretty fucking amazing.  What the fuck was on it?  Bechamel sauce?!  Holy shit. I can only wonder what it tasted like when it was fresh from the oven."
0,"I went to this place twice. The food was okay. It is very homemade grandma's cooking kind of feel. There is nothing that will make you ""WOW"" about.  If you want something plain and boring this is a place to go. The service is NOT so great. They seated us and never gave us bread until we requested for it! After we go the bread it was just plain dry bread with nothing to dip. So we had to request again for the dippings. This happened both times I went! The place is tight. You can hear the other tables convo very clearly! The third time I attempt to go I had a drink with me. (I was with a friend who likes some of the dishes they had there. So I was dragged along.) They would not seat me until I dump my drink out! Its not like iam not going to order YOUR food. What is the big deal? I walked right back out! The food was okay like I said but the service and because of my experience, I would not be returning any time soon. I understand the food is cheap you get what you pay for but seriously you are spending money here at this restaurant you deserve some kind of decent treatment. The place right next to it has the same rating. At least the waiters are so much more nicer!"
0,"Great service, great food. Always a winner. I recommend the cod and the sea bass. I have been twice and the food and service has been consistent. Highly recommend."
0,"Pricey, but good!"
1,"This place is pretty awesome.  My friend Grace, who has a degree from culinary school and is going to grad school for food science, swears by this place, so I had to check it out. Ray and I sat at the bar, and we ordered the: Scallops Crudo  (excellent) a pasta with fontina cheese and brussel sprouts (favorite dish) hangar steak (decent) cauliflower (pretty horrible, way too salty and oily) broccoli rabe (average, also salty and oily) olive oil cake (quite good) panna cotta (quite good) The service is top notch.  Be careful - the wine glasses have VERY thin stems.  I actually broke a glass setting it on the table, and I wasn't even that drunk (or so I thought).   The staff was there in a second to clean it up and they were very gracious."
0,Everything I've had here has been absolutely delicious.  There are great vegetarian options and the desserts are to die for.  Highly recommended.
0,"Glad to see that others agree that this is AUTHENTIC indian and fine at that. Great naan, great chicken tikka and korma. Flavors of the curry are bold and spicy and perfection. Planning on bringing my friends in for sure."
1,Excellent service. Food tasted great but more impressive was the presentation. We got some free digestives at the end.
1,Visited Basso 56 for Dinner on Christmas. Place was packed but was still comfortable and was still able to have a conversation. Food was very fresh and had decent flavor. I went for the Branzino which was roasted whole. The server filet it for me since i requested it. Service was great. Very reasonable Wine Selection. Found a great red wine for $40 for the bottle. Overall great experience. Food is pretty basic italian nothing outrageous but thats what we were looking for christmas dinner.
1,"To be honest, I've been here a dozen times and have had nothing but the fried dumplings.  One of these days I will try something else, such as the noodles [I've seen them being made, a pretty cool show]. But the fried dumplings are so phenomenal and so ridiculously cheap [ $3 for a dozen!!!!] I just inhale them."
0,One of my favorite restaurant's in the city!  Indoor/outdoor garden is beautiful.  Food is lovely.  A hidden gem in the heart of the Villge.  I've been eating here for years and it remains one of my all time favorites.  My personal favorites- the Lamb chops or the homemade Gnocchi. They recently added a new place next door called Aperitivo...just as quaint and comfortable- here you can get tasty bites and wine out of beautiful etched glasses.   I feel like I'm at home every time I visit.
0,"loves this place, me and my family went to this hometown when we where visiting brooklyn and loved this place..  the  best bbq ever!!!"
1,"Even as a vegetarian this place gets 5 stars just for the gallon beers they serve!  We came for dinner on a Monday night so it was fairly quiet, we had walked past on Saturday night and it was packed.  We walked straight in and joined the line to order food.  The line was short and we got served in a few minutes.  I ordered a couple of sides - broccoli salad, saurerkraut and potato salad.  My husband ordered sausage, brisket and ribs.  We got a seat outside, as inside was full, it was a little chilly but we didn't mind at all.  The salads i had were really quite nice and they give you a couple of bread rolls each as well.  This was enough for me.  My hubby perhaps ordered enough to feed 2-3 people, but he did a pretty good job of getting through it.  He said that the meat was delicous and he would for sure come back!   The part that i loved was the beer.  They have a pretty good beer selection and they pour it by the gallon.  As an aussie i really didn't know how big a gallon was, i kinda thought it was a normal growler size.  So i ordered a gallon of beer for the 2 of us.  As i was carrying it back to the table, i realized how big it actually was - 4 litres.  We did a pretty good job of finishing it off, but only got about 3/4 of the way through it and had to leave it.   This would be the kind of place that would be awesome to come with a group of friends, share a couple of gallons of beer and for the meat eaters, eat some awesome BBQ."
1,My 100th review goes to my favorite pizza place in NYC.  Read my previous reviews and GO!  Chili oil is a MUST!
1,This was a former cd shop that just had amazingly diverse selections.  Now it spawned an amazing slider shop!  These taste bombs are delicious with the chipotle ketchup.  Best all around value at $2 and competitive to any of the up-market burgers out there.
1,"A gem! I have never written those words in a review before. I did not know what they meant until now. I have never been as surprised (pleasantly so) when I walked into a restaurant in New York. Up Thai is breath of fresh air, like finding that $20 in your jacket pocket you forgot you got from the ATM a month ago. You walk into Up Thai and you smile because the tiny store front hides a literal oasis of delicious Thai food and amazing decor, amid Turkish restaurants, on a very ordinary street. Today, I went with friends for lunch. Their lunch special (which includes soup or salad, appetizer, and entree) was $9. Yes. That is not a typo. Oh yeah. Fantastic. The food was really good, fresh, and spicy. The service was excellent. And the restaurant itself was just so pretty. Even the bathroom was pretty! This place deserves its 4 star rating. It has earned it!"
0,"It's interesting to hear how impressionable most people are. You follow other's reviews and forget to be true to the experience. With that said, I was in no way impressed by the mediocre service provided and the back-to-basic ground food served. Maybe people flock to see what's the hype, but as a ""real"" New Yorker you truly know of so many hidden gems that provide better service, tastier food, all at a cheaper price. No matter what my thoughts are, and that of others, you're probably still going to go and check the spot out - because now you're full of curiosity about it's pros and cons. Sad that all in all it equals more business for such a lame restaurant. In conclusion, decide on your own... But I surely wouldn't recommend spending your time, money, and energy."
0,Love this place! This place makes food that makes my mouth water all up!
0,"Love the kale salad, wait staff, and that they off organic chicken and beef. I wish the fish was wild instead of farm raised. It can get crowded for brunch, but they have outside seating, which means more food outside. Love."
0,"Can 5000+ people be wrong?  Go here, go easy on the hot sauce and drown it in white magic sauce.  You will wake up feeling a few pounds heavier but as my girl Donna says, ""Treat yo self!"""
0,"Apparently, the reason why the Strawberry Waffle for my 5yo son was served 20 MINUTES LATER than both mine and my husband's orders was that ""they had to make it fresh"" (ah! what a joke - should I have expected a stale one to get a better service?). When the waffle finally got to our table, it was barely lukewarm. Hence, the waiting was even more unjustified. I pointed that out to the waitress telling her that that kind of timing was unacceptable. The waitress only concern was taking the plate away from my son (who still hadn't even taken a bite and that after that was in tears) informing me that she'd already proceed to take that out of our bill. All the while she didn't even stop at our table to properly hear us out. The experience was so awful, I signed up on yelp for my very first review."
0,Horrible experience. Hostess was rude. Will never go to this place again because of the service.
1,"I went here while I was hitting all of the LIC spots on the beer passport, so we had already eaten and drank enough at the first two spots. Our waitress was still really nice even though we didn't order much, which is a rare thing that was much appreciated. The space was great - I loved the sign in the back and their custom booths. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the neighborhood."
1,"Sunday brunch at Traif outside in the enclosed patio with the view of the garden - Priceless. We got there at 11:30am right when it opened and got seating no problem at all. The enclosed patio is nice because the restaurant had the portable heaters on so you can still enjoy being ""outside"" without being too cold. I wanted a light brunch so I ordered the Egg-in-a-nest (brie roast portabella grilled cheese and truffle cream). Let me tell you something. It was not light.  It was amazing because it seemed like they grilled on butter and the whole sandwich was oozing with delicious butter. The texture on the grilled cheese was like a bit crunchy, a bit creamy, and savory. It was perfect. E had the chilaquiles. It was very filling and creamy but the taste got tiring if you are eating the whole thing. We also ordered bacon doughnuts with the coffee ice cream. I was a bit disappointed in it as i was expecting this strong bacon taste with the donut. It seems that they just glazed it with the slight taste of bacon and added bacon bits."
1,This is a nice Italian place in upper east side. I had lasagne and meat balls. We also had octopus as appetizer. Everything was really good and truly Italian ( I am Italian!).
0,"Did this as the second stop of our monthly pizza crawl and have to say the square margarita was fantastic. The sauce had just the perfect mix of garlic, tomato and basil and mozzarella with drizzle of olive oil made it almost perfection."
1,Great way to go when in a rush
0,"Seriously ?! Ugh ! After reading all the good reviews , I decided to give this place a try. Obviously, Greenwich village hillbillies don't know what a true falafel tastes like !  3 bucks for HALF a falafel sandwich ! That's more evil than paying 20 for a slice of pizza.   The falafel itself was cracked and way tooooo crispy.  I felt as if I was eating chips. Instead of Israeli salad , they put lettuce in their pita bread !  This place is tiny and there is no place for you to turn or move once inside.  I am giving it one star because the pita bread was warm and sort of crispy too.   If you love falafels , go there , you""ll hate it."
1,"Amazeballs! This pizza is excellent, and the whole experience of dining here was a highlight of my afternoon. Busy restaurant where waiting for a table is normal. Fortunately, we only waited to be seated in about 20 minutes. It feels like a traditional east-coast italian joint, with brick walls, red-checked table cloths, wine and sangria served in carafes, and black and white framed photos on the walls. They are famous for their pizza, and one bite later, you will see why. Delicious chewy crust, slightly thicker version of NY style, but not overly so. Cheesy, but not in excess. Well seasoned tomato sauce. Great balance of ingredients. Vegetarian pizza toppings are delicious and aren't lacking in flavor or substance. All in all, some of the best 'za I have ever consumed."
0,"This place is awesome. I just got back from New York a couple weeks ago. The only downside is that it is always packed! I went and did a wine tasting while I was there, only because it was the only thing without a line! Wine was good and the entire place is a little overwheming but it is such a cool place. Would recommend going here to check it out."
0,"i find this restaurant during my vacation. it was a really good suprise for me the food was amazing,and  i find a litle part of france in brooklyn the price are cheap to if  you whant eat some  verry good food go there ."
1,"I enjoy going to this place because they got good home style food.   I really hated it when Bourdain came to this place.  He tends to ruin places that he puts on TV.   Even on a Monday night I still had to wait for a table.  Pre-Bourdain, Monday was a short/no wait night.   Dessert is a steal at this place and food is always fun to eat.  Good to get together with friends or a late night drink."
1,"Wow! Excellent food, great service, and not hoity toity. What more can you ask for..."
0,This place was fantastic. I was at the smith last week for lunch and cannot complain. Everything we ordered was great. especially steamed mussels!! The burger sauce is out of the world. Dipping the shoe string fries in it is even better!
0,"In its way as startling as El Bulli. Clearly grounded in a country's cuisine traditions but elevating them to very great heights of flavour, subtlety and intensity. We had expected refined but trad Korean, in fact we ate something as good as, but a little different from the best of French two star dining. Go with the same mindset as you would for any other haut cuisine you will be seduced - don't go expecting big, noisy and filling."
0,EASE UP ON THE SALT.... I love this place but someone needs to hide the salt shaker from the chef.
1,This is a two part-review: 1. Get the lasagna with the 6-hour meat ragu. 2. Leave happy. (Service is friendly but a little slow at times. Menu is small so make sure they have something you like before you go.)
1,"For what I had this place was definitely 5 stars and I was most definitely impressed. The pizza was fantastic! Very think crust with fresh mozzarella topped with salame. It is decently priced for the location and quality most definitely. I was with my girl friends and we did splitsy of a nice big salad with big slices of Parmesan and a light, subtle dressing and a large pizza. It was perfect. A bottle of wine for $35 and call it a day. The service was great, with some real Italians serving me my meal and did we talk about the delicious, doughy, and plentiful bread that came in a brown bag that accompanied our meal? 'Cause if we didn't, it was delicious and was a great touch to a great meal. I didn't try the pastas or any appetizers so I can't attest to that fare but if you are lookin for pizza and a salad - this is most definitely your place. I have now read about the happy hour and will most definitely be coming back to check it out - update to be had."
0,"Decidedly mediocre. Decent burger, but for $14/15? $13 cocktails featured a scarcity of alcohol. OK place if you're starving, but expensive for what you get...there are so many better options."
0,"Dependable, fresh, quality food served with panache and style at one of the best value eateries in all of NYC. Chef Gallagher and his crew produce amazingly consistent, delicious food in this bustling fast-paced eatery. Yet, somehow one never feels rushed. There are two floor levels and several rooms - I like the first floor, front room myself, this is where all the 'action' is! But the upstairs and back rooms are somewhat quieter and more spacious. The bar room is, as one might guess - noisy and cramped especially when the pre-theatre crowd arrives. The bar tenders are fabulous and fun. They're also very good at wine recommendations for those uninitiated or timid about wines. Reservations - usually 30 days in advance of your visit - are a MUST. You have almost no chance of being seated in the restaurant proper without one - especially in the evening. Reservations are less important at lunch time. BTW - one may always eat at the bar without benefit of reservations, but it's hard-to-get seating, especially on theater nights. Wines are the best value at Becco and there is a robust selection of excellent, good quality wines at a - yes, I'm serious --- a $25 price point --- Yes, I said $25.00 ---- in NYC! It's a great pre-theatre place and wonderful for a post-performance drink and perhaps a late snack. I've been many times and, of all the restaurants in the city, this is by far my favorite. I'll be there in another 3 weeks and I'm really looking forward to it! It never gets old!"
0,"The most amazing atmosphere and best chicken satay this side of heaven.  I totally recommend you try them out, and their prices are suprisingly great."
1,"The first or second restaurant I come to when I visit New York. I've told all my friends about it, but none of them ever go. Losers! I don't mind sharing tables, or the wait. The dumplings are the reason to go (just say ""one crab"" or ""one pork"" when you sit down, and they'll know what you mean and bring you a steaming basket of soup dumpings). Sure, we usually end up eating several orders of them, but we pace ourselves since cold dumplings are no good. I also like their Shanghai style noodles and onion pancakes. Warning, the soup is hot and will burn you! You will need to be careful or you will lose your taste buds for the rest of the night. As I walk through Chinatown I like to tear my eyes from the bustling street scene and look up at the old New York architecture."
0,"OUTSTANDING food and service. Stumbled upon this gem yesterday whilst cruising around LES. Not only is the food incredibly tasty, they have a fantastic beer menu to boot. The ribs..... WOW. They must be the best in the city. The waiters were really laid back, yet still wonderfully attentive. Loved the vibe in this place, will definitely be coming here again."
0,"i had my daughter's bridal shower in the cozy, light-filled back room at palo santo.  the guests were greeted with cheery glasses of bubbling prosecco, perfect for ramping up the festive feel and toasting the special occasion.  the food was scrumptious, served family style on large platters that never seemed to empty, as replacements were brought in as soon as guests began devouring what was there.  everything was delicious, but the pollo guisado and heritage pork were divine with lovely little morsels of pupusas to round out the flavors.  gonzalo, the events coordinator, could not have been more gracious or accommodating.  i highly recommend this venue!"
0,Shade is my regular bar. Every chance I get I go. AMAZING bartenders... hilarious and quick. Divey bar with a great personality. Crepes and sandwiches are also great which is a huge plus. Would give them 10 stars if I could.
0,"The food is GREAT and I have always loved coming here, BUT last Saturday 3/1/14 was the last time I ever step foot in this place. We got there at 11pm and were seated right away, but the bouncer who asked us how many, would turn to the hostess, who would look at you and your party and if you didn't fit her criteria, you were denied. Never once, over the next hour of letting people in and denying others, did she look at her manifest to see what tables were free. The only way she  decided whether people could get in was based on their look. For them to be so openly discriminatory towards paying patrons who just want a good meal I cant rock with."
1,"This place is awesome ! Cant believe that it took me so long to come by! Ordered the watermelon salad and foiegras plus a bunch of daily specials ! Everything was so amazing that by the time the bouillabaisse came out (their specialty) we were even a little underwhelmed - not saying this in a bad way just saying EVERYTHING is so good I wouldn't be scared to shake it up go for specials. menu is very seasonal and awesome and love the vibe of this place !!! the foie is seriouslyyy so good ! also, bring some nice wine, its worth it :D"
1,"I came here late to sit in the garden after a night of drinking with some friends and had a quick bite. The first think you notice in the garden is the 4 gigantic lampshades covering up some trees sans leaves. The pattern on them is multicolored, almost tie-dye like, and sets the mood by splashing soft hints of color throughout the garden. We were going to order a cheap bottle of wine, but our waiter would not let us order it! Turns out he had seen a bottle of it turn out sour earlier that evening. He suggested a different bottle which was similarly priced and we loved it. We ordered a tray of prosciutto with focaccia, the pumpkin cognac cheesecake, and the caramel custard, each excellent. I know it is a semi-exposed garden and all, but seeing a small mouse run under the lonely tables in the corner really ruined the experience for me. The other members of my party did not feel the same way."
0,"Good food. Okay prices....the wait and host staf...EHH! So mean! But the food is so good, you kind of turn a blind eye. GET THE MACARONI AND CHEESE SPRING ROLLS!\"
1,"Oh. My. God! How have I gone so long in my life without having had Filipino food?! I literally want to stomach punch myself for not having tried it sooner. Maharlika changed my life forever because I am now in love. My sister made reservations a day in advance for a Saturday night with no issues and then pushed said reservations back an hour when we were running late with no problems! They were very accommodating! I could already tell that the service was gona be great (and I was right but more on that later!) The restaurant is very small and cozy. Normally close quarters like that leave me wishing I was somewhere else but Maharlika was the exception. It only added to the atmosphere and setting. There was definitely a homey quality to love! Our waiter was really nice and helped explain the dishes since it was my first time eating Filipino. In the end, my group decided on the crispy pork belly and sizzling sisig for appetizers. The crispy pork belly - while good- didn't really leave as much of an impression as the sisig did. The sisig was phenom!!!!! I loved the homemade quality to it and the flavors that made eating such odd bits of pig so delicious! For my entree I ordered the Ube Waffle and Chicken. Personally this was a no brainer for me because I love purple yams. The waffles had such a great taste and texture to them. I didn't even need their homemade sauce with it because the waffles as so good on its own! The fried chicken was great too. Perfectly crispy skin to go with my perfectly delicious meal! I also had the opportunity to try some of my friends dishes like the Kare Kare (woo owes I'm getting this next time!) and a specialty dish of tilapia stuffed squid. Maharlika woo'ed me and won my heart. It was such a great dining experience that I can't wait to have more Filipino food. My only gripe is that I feel like the prices were a bit steep for what it was. Each entree was around $22 or more. The appetizers all fell into the $15-20 range, and were quite small. Maharlika was definitely an experience but I'm open to trying other, more affordable Filipino restaurants- even if it means going all the way to Woodside. :)"
0,"LOVE this place!  (So happy to have somewhere other then Champion- cooler than thou- can't even say good morning baristas)They make a great latte, interior is fabulous and most of all-they are so sweet! The owner is great. Can't wait til they serve wine."
1,"I love that several of my favorite unpretentious upscale eateries are now conveniently in one location!  Some of my faves: Dos Toros, Num Pang, Dig Inn and Skinny Pizza.   Some nights it can sound a bit hectic especially if there are families with young ones but most of the times I have been there it has been pretty peaceful.  Love sitting by the windows and looking out at the water.  Brookfield Place has become my go-to quiet and quick dinner one or two nights during the week!"
1,"Food was AMAZING! We had the Thai Chicken Spring Rolls and the Shrimp Flatbread. The flavors were incredible. We had no problem getting a seat at the bar. The bartender was knowledgable and was generous with beer tastings until we found the right fit. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because when it came time to settle up, it was very hard to get someone's attention. Overall, I would recommend this place."
1,"i've been going to this place for half my life, and it's still good.  but the price has been creeping up a quarter or two per year and, worse, their sandwiches are right about half of the size they were just a couple of years ago.  they definitely shrank their portions/size several times in that period of time."

1,"The most amazing food that I have had in a long time .. I'm a big Italian food lover and this was a blast from my childhood ., the sauce was light and flavorful. If you are in NY you must try this place.. Amazing ."
0,"This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in new york. I had never had ramen until I went there, and every ramen bowl I've eaten since does not compare. The steamed pork buns are amazing!!! The line is usually insane, but i usually give them my cell number after putting my name in for a table, then i walk to the irish pub on the corner to get away from the crowd. It works like a charm."
1,Love this place so much. The best slice of pizza in NYC!! There's always a line out the door for a reason. So be prepare to wait in line.
1,"Very small, cute, cozy restaurant. Hard to miss because of the blue light! Food: 5/5. They serve small appetizer/tapas plates as well as full meals, some of which are in bento boxes! The beans were full of garlic and delicious; the purnil was a bit salty, but still packed with flavor. The arepas have a delicious sauce with them, I highly recommend them as an appetizer. Service: generally great The staff is friendly and attentive: my glass of water was never low. I made a reservation beforehand, and they called 40 minutes beforehand to inform me that reservations were running behind and to show up half an hour later. Overall, a great experience with fantastic food."
1,This place is awesome. A lovely Park Slope institution. Brunch in the garden is great. Mmm margaritas!
1,"The Pier 1 cafe is too close from our apartment building and is one of our regular spots during summer time. The cheese burger with fries is EXQUISITE, the red wine absolutely delicious, in general all the food is so good and the views at night are AMAZING. Too bad is just open from May-September because the winter weather. If you are in the UWS area and feel like having a great food with nice views pay a visit to Pier 1 cafe!"
1,"Although my heart will forever belong to Ippudo, a one night stand with Minca left me feeling quite satisfied. Minca is a traditionalist ramen shop, the kind that fits in perfectly in the East Village, devoid of any glitz or ambience. It turns out bowl after bowl of steaming hot pork broth, slices of fat laced pork, and slightly chewy and dense ramen noodles. A side order of gyozas turned to be a plate of perfectly pan fried dumplings with a juicy and authentic filling. Minca is the perfect place to go when you don't want to deal with the Momofuku hype, can't stand the 1 hour+ wait at Ippudo, and don't feel like rubbing elbows with the NYU crowd at Setagaya.  The no frills attitude demonstrates respect for this great culinary tradition. With all the ramen joints scrambling to grab a share of the marketplace, Minca proves to me the reason why it earns top marks."
0,"Yummmmmmmmmm! Late nite happiness. SOme of these fries with that Pesto Mayo, made my nite!"
0,Very nice restaurant. The food is very good and original (crab fried rice cooked in a coconut shell !). Cocktails are delicious too. A good address in West Village.
0,"This place is an undiscovered gem.  We have eaten there twice and the food was amazing both times.  The menu is very fish focused, but also vegetarian and vegan friendly.  If you can get a seat outside in the back, do it.  It is so lovely!  Highly recommended!!"
1,"We were lucky to get to Ippudo at 6:15 on a Wednesday and endure only a 15 min wait.  I know, right?! Damn. What a hip joint.  We really enjoyed the 2 for 1 sapporos (3$ each *jaw drop*) at the bar.  There's club music playing which would be cheesy anywhere else but they pull it off here. We were ushered to a long community table with dim lighting and cool branch thingies coming out of the middle.  The service there is impeccable, there isn't a designated server so any dude you flag down will help you out. the ramen was not the best i had. we both got the Akamaru ramen with the special umami miso paste. I wasn't a huge fan of the super skinny noodles but the broth was super complex and ON POINT Unfortunately i'm a big fan of toppings and the ramen was lacking it, unless you wanted to pay for extra.   At 15$ a bowl, it was a bit steep for what we got.  The free green tea afterwards was a nice touch.  I hear there appetizers are really good, so all around, its a sweet spot for a date, but would probably not make a point to return if i was craving ramen and definitely not if I had to wait longer than 20 minutes."
1,"Overhyped.Overcrowded.Overpriced. Strictly for tourists and those who do not find mind numbing crowds overwhelming and annoying. I can get most if not all of this stuff locally, better and cheaper. Mario Batali should be ashamed to call himself an Italian. Greedy would be a much better word."
1,"I cannot believe I have not written a review for Yuca!  I have been coming here so many times over the past couple years.  I have come here for brunch so many times, for dinner a couple times and for happy hour once.  All the times that I have come here, the servers have always been really nice.  The place has plenty of seating, but during the busy times, there can be a wait.  The ambiance is really nice - comfortable and chill setting.  On warm days, there is outside seating. The food is really good; I must have tried almost everything on that menu.  For brunch, my absolute fave would have to be the Arepas Benedictos with Salmon.  I absolutely love their sangria.  The prices are very good for the quality of food.  They have great happy hour deals. I've always loved this place - this is my go-to brunch place.  I've made a fan out of everyone I've brought here.  ;-)"
1,Yummy chicken~
0,Lemon linguine. who knew such a simple dish could be so amazing?? get it!
0,"went for the bottomless bellini brunch today- the food, service and drinks were amazing!! Can't recommend this place enough- The burger was the best I've had in NYC!! The owner Alon was attentive, charming and sent a complimentary Halvah desert that was really delicous, Making reservations for next weekend and bringing  friends.  Cudo's to Danielle the bartender who kept the drinks flowing!!"
0,"Great people, great service, great food."
0,"I do not know what every had been raving about but this restaurant is horrible.  The first time I went  was for a friend's birthday.  I had somewhere else in mind but his gf wanted to go here so that was it.  Atmosphere was just like any other large restaurant.  There were lots of people there and thus lots of noise.  What made me give this only one star was the fact that everything we ordered was just disgusting.  All the food was very Americanized and extremely salty.  I don't think I tasted one good dish there that night.  If you like Americanized food and want to have kidney failure real soon then go eat there, but if you want real authentic food then go elsewhere.  You have been warned!"
1,"Great brunch spot. Honestly, my only complaint is the location. The staff was very friendly and helpful with choosing from the menu. I ordered the corncakes with carmelized bananas and cinnamon butter, which were very good. Along with the sausage patty which had a bit of a kick to it which was nice. The frittata was very yummy, must have with the hot sauce!!!!! I would def. go back"
0,This is the best Place or breakfast lunch and dinner. I went 3 times in  7days
1,Good ceviche but the main course was very bland but the service was good.  I've been to this place 3 times and its the same each time.  I end up dumping the green sauce on everything to give the dishes flavor. The wait staff is super friendly though.
0,"For a New York thin crust slice, it doesnt get better that Di Fara. All of the health code issues you hear about here did not deter me from what I've heard is the best pizza in NY. We went on a rainy day and got there around noon on a Sunday. I was a little agitated as there is no where to park and my friend and I were both starving. Luckily we got there before the line and got our pizza really quickly. Its cute watching the 2 guys shred cheese and roll dough. Very old school vibe. The environment is a little bleak but the minute you smell the fresh basil they cut directly onto you pizza you quickly forget about it. Yumm Im smiling right now thinking about it."
0,Holy crap. This Pizza blew my mind. It was like a nostalgic bite into the world of the tomato and cheese. You can see teh freshness and feel the garlic. I could never have thought that i would be this proud of myself jsut for stumbling upon this euphoria of flavor. I want to spend the rest of my life searching out and craving this kind of pizza. The price was so amazing that i coudl easily come here all the time. i coudl easily afford to eat all of this stuff as often as I want and as often as i should. this is a great pizza. I recommend it to all my friends. Even those friends of mien that can no longer enjoy solid goods.
0,"Great place for a business lunch/dinner. The quality of food is great. The quality of sushi was amazing. I've never tasted fish as fresh as at this place. The stuff is more formal than friendly, but the service was great and all of us had a great experience at this place. Highly recommended. Especially for NYorkers who understand how to distinguish good from very good ;-)"
1,"Totto Ramen is a good, solid ramen house..just nothing extremely out of the ordinary... It's a cute, ""underground"" ramen hole-in-the-wall with just a few tables and a bar area. The wait can be lengthy due to the limited seating, so put your name on the list and walk around the neighborhood! The ramen broth and meat here are good, but I felt that the noodles were chewy but nothing special - pretty thin noodles, actually. Had the Totto Spicy Ramen - it wasn't overwhelmingly spicy..just a little bit. Great pork buns, too!"
0,Best grilled cheese ever! Ordered a few times on seamless and was never disappointed. You guys are my new favorite! Keep up the good work:)
1,"Much closer to me than Lucali's, and easier to grub on as they sell by the slice.  The self-serve  roasted garlic and marinated chopped hot peppers elevate a good pizza to excellent.  Highly recommend."
1,This place is amazing! The first time I came here was a very hungover day and I only managed to taste the short ends which was torture. Craving that deliciousness I finally returned a few months later and it was everything I imagined and more. Burnt ends on a sandwich and burnt end baked beans are a must! I will definitely be back for seconds.
1,"Allow me to tell you that I am never coming back here again. As much as I love xiao long biao, the fact that you actually came back and demanded I pay you the fucking 11 cents that I was short from the 15% TIP was WAYYYYYYYYY too much for me to handle. Not to mention the complete lack of real chinese food. Hunan/sesame chicken?  Overly salted string beans? Overpriced and NOT worth even 5 bucks in my book. Good bye."
0,Came here for dinner and I did not like this. The food was ok although I didn't think it was worth the price. The atmosphere was like a tavern. Kinda weird.
0,"stopped in with a few friends and boy, they make the BEST mind erasers.  i don't remember anything after that."
1,"I have been back here twice this week... I know! But I love it, I always get the chicken flautas, sometimes with rice and beans... next time i'll try the chorizo taco, my friend got it tonight and loved it!"
0,"Giovanni's Brooklyn Eats is not only a welcome sight to Windsor Terrace but to Brooklyn in general.  It's an absolute pleasure to see a cozy, warm, friendly neighborhood place open that wants to serve good food, at the right prices and treat you like family.  I have been there twice now and both times I was either waited on by Giovanni himself or his sister.  They are both enthusiastic about what they do and who they are doing it for.   Now on to the experience.  The first time my family and I went there we were thrilled with what was going on at Giovanni's.  Very simply we had wonderful meals that were prepared well, flavorful and most importantly made with fresh items.  I can't tell you how many restaurants miss the boat on this.  The pasta was rustic, al dente and delicious and my Tilapia Oregenata was out of sight.  I beleive we also had parmesan fritters that were wonderful. Here's where I want to help Giovanni a little.  Many restaurants in our area suffer from the slump.  The first time you go to a place you have a great meal, but by the next time, they begin to slip.  This is not to say that Giovanni's is slipping but there are a few suggestions I have after our second experience that may help.  We had meat and seafood dishes this time and they were...dare I say it...boring and simple.  The salmon was very basic and presented almost too simply and they chicken piccata I had although good, well, you can get that same dish at a million places.  In addition, you make such a better impression when, if you are going to serve bread, choose really great bread and serve it warm  It makes a big difference and bread good bread is so easy to get in New York.  In addition, the broccoli that came with my chicken piccata was, well, limp and had very little flavor.  Saute broccoli with love oil and garlic should not be a challenge for an Italian restaurant. So, yes, go to Giovanni's Brooklyn Eats, the food is good, the people are nice, the atmosphere is cozy and help me cheer on and support Giovanni so he strives even higher with his product."
1,"Very nice place with authentic Latin food and music. It's cash only so have some cash! The chicken cutlet with rice and brand is very good and the flan is amazing as well. I wouldn't go without trying their cafe con leche, it's delicious. I came with my girlfriend when we visited from Tampa, FL and it was so good we went there twice!"
1,"3.5 stars. Bumped up to 4 stars since we came when the restaurant just opened and there was no wait. Hm. Is Lombardi's pizza one of the best pizza joints NY has to offer? Maybe the hype got to me, but the pizza didn't seem too special to me (personally, I'd have Cheeseboard in Berkeley over Lombardi's any day). If you're comparing the pizza to any fast pizza chain, there's no doubt it's 20x better. Nonetheless, a great restaurant and very affordable--just not *super."
1,We had the lox crepe and the shrimp & avocado. Wonderful! Fresh ingredients and friendly service. Clean establishment. Can't wait to go back to try the sweet dessert crepes!
0,"This place has a great atmosphere! It's a cozy little Italian spot, but it also has an amazing outdoor seating area when the weather is nice. Very quaint and it does not feel like you're in NY anymore, which is a welcome relief at times. I had the sweet potato sage ravioli. It was delicious. I often find ravioli portions to be on the puny side but this was the perfect side. I even had enough to share! My dining companions got the pasta with breadcrumbs and veggies and the gnocchi with spicy sausage. Mine was the best, for sure. Also delightful were the crostini we split, the chickpea one was surprising and addictive, the one with ricotta and speck was creamy, salty, heavenly. The highlight for me was meeting Merlin, the French Bulldog in the Frankie's logo! Their cheeses were yummy! I had a lamb dish with pasta in it, it was the perfect portion. It's REALLY not that expensive! Try it!"
0,"We wanted Chinese food but the wait was way too long. After popping open the Yelp app we found this spot was right across the street. The food and the service were both great, with the wait staff constantly filling up our waters and checking in on us. We were put at the communal table in the middle and I will never understand how a restaurant expects you to sit on a stool without a seatback for an extended period and have a comfortable dinner, but we had a good crowd and so still had a good time. Definitely the best pad see ew I've ever had. My girlfriend had a fun twist on a classic dish - pad thai with the noodles made out of zucchini. Everything here felt very fresh and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the area."
0,"I just had the best mushroom ravioli ever.  I've been here several times and the items from the menu that I've tried - such as the penne with chicken - have all been awesome, but the mushroom ravioli took the cake. A side of sparkling raspberry iced tea, and my afternoon couldn't have been better."
1,"Wow. I couldn't be happier that this place just opened up. I just moved here and was pretty sad at the lack of coffee shops in the area but now Manny's is open! There is not one thing about this place I don't like. Coffee is great, food selection is on point and the customer service is amazing. The people behind the counter are so welcoming  and happy. I am beyond ecstatic that this place is here. It's really a great spot, 100% recommended!"
1,"Lockyard is a really cool place. I think its genius to have a Beer Garden in Bay Ridge why not?! Bay Ridge is completely populated with bars so this was the perfect addition. The bar itself is neatly set up inside and of course the backyard area is the main attraction. Ive come here during the fall season when the outdoor heater was turned up and it worked like a charm. The service is on the money and the beer selection is crazy in a good way! They have they're regular menu along with they're weekly menu for beer selection. I have to honestly say though I was STUNNED the first time I came here and wanted to order a drink and by drink I mean Vodka and then realized that they have NO hard liquor AT ALL. At first I thought that was a little lame because all other beer gardens still have liquor but it actually preserves the idea of a BEER GARDEN! Duh! So I get it and Im totally feeling it now. Now I would have given this place 5 stars but I have to knock one star off for the food. Its not bad but its just ""Ok"" If your drunk it'll probably taste amazing but this particular occasion I was  sober and I wasn't feeling it too much. I tried the cheeseburger and the hot dog. Again it wasn't terrible but nothing memorable."

0,One of the best Thai places in the city!

0,"First ate here on my birthday and loved this place so much we decided to hold our wedding reception in their back patio two weeks ago.  After planning a year in advance and solid confirmation of our reservation we arrive to the restaurant the day of our wedding dinner, only to be told ""you're here for what?"". Turns out our party wasn't scheduled in the calendar and they weren't prepared to host us. Despite the negligent mix-up and after crying in my wedding dress surrounded by our 20+ plus guests, the staff did an amazing job and scrambled to make it all happen. We actually love the food here and always make it a point to talk it up, but the management response to their own error was truly disappointing and tainted what was a promised to be an awesome event."
0,I love the ability to try different meats here. They're quick and easy for takeout too
1,"This is one of a few extremely popular Sunday brunch spots in the area.  1.5-hour waits are not uncommon.   Portions are large, service is very good.  Coffee was pretty good.  Got the biscuit and sausage gravy, which was great.  Heavy, but flavorful.  If you like spice, I recommend their hot sauce; not vinegar-based like Tabasco, but a Sriracha-like consistency (taste was a little different than Sriracha). I also ordered the grits but sorta regretted it.  It's a very creamy grit bowl, with a lot of shavings of cheese on top.  Since the grits weren't super-hot (temp-wise), the cheese didn't really melt, so it was just a super-smooth (almost watery) cheese grits, with clumps of extra cheese.  I like grits to have more texture so this was pretty disappointing. I'll still come back here --- table next to ours had fried chicken and it looked pretty good.  Recommend going there early on the weekend; it's pretty busy almost all day on Sunday."
0,I love coming here with my friends . I love the cocktails $1 oyster sundays and the mouthwatering ceviches.

1,"Delicious noodles! I came here with my girlfriend and a friend for a cheap, yet delicious dinner in Chinatown. We ordered a variety of items - Fried Dumplings, Fujanese Fish Ball Soup, House Special Hand Pulled Noodles #1, Roast Duck Hand Pulled Noodles and Duck Pan Fried Noodles. All of the items were delicious! We made sure to order different types of noodles with each of the noodle soups so that we can get a taste for all of the different kinds that they offer here. I normally dislike fried dumplings. Whenever there's a steamed option, I go for it. My friend insisted they were delicious, though, so I gave them a try. These fried dumplings were amazing. They weren't dried out inside at all, they crispy on the outside and very, very juicy on the inside! I haven't had fried dumplings like this ever before. Order these for sure - especially if you don't normally enjoy fried dumplings. They may give you a new perspective on the dish. The Fujanese Fish Ball Soup was unlike anything I've ever tried before! Their Fujanese fish balls actually have pork inside! I never knew that was an option. It was a welcome surprise and made the normally average fish balls have a different taste than usual. The soup that they were in was pretty simple, there were no noodles and the broth wasn't particularly amazing. Everything here is so cheap, though, so if you're at all interested in trying pork stuffed fish balls, I would give it a try. We ordered the House Special Hand Pulled Noodles #1 with the Regular Hand Pulled Noodles. The broth in soup was by far the best out of any soup we ordered. It was very, very flavorful, you can tell that it absorbed the flavor of the oxtail, beef, tripe and tendon. All of the different cuts of meat were tender and were delicious! I'm salivating right now just thinking of a spoonful of noodles with a piece of oxtail! I would definitely recommend giving this one a try - not only was the broth good, but it also gives you a variety of the different cuts of meat restaurant offers. Next was the Roast Duck Hand Pulled Noodles with Knife Cut Noodles. To be totally honest, the broth was a dud, the duck was good, but the reason I'm even going into detail on this dish at all was the Knife Cut Noodles. They were really, really good. Each noodle has a unique shape from the knife and they come in different widths and lengths as well. You can really taste the fresh dough they used to make these since you have such a variety of shapes and sizes. I think next time my soup of choice will be the House Special #1 with these Knife Cut Noodles. By the end of the meal we were essentially making this dish ourselves: we took a spoonful of broth from the House Special #1 and combined it with the Knife Cut Noodles. Awesome combination! Our last entree was the Roast Duck Pan Fried Noodles with Wide Hand Pulled Noodles. I really enjoyed the wide noodles. They were tasty and were an interesting departure from the regular noodles in the House Special #1. They still couldn't compare with the Knife Cut Noodles, though. The main attraction of this dish, though, is the meat. The pieces of duck here were very good! Not too fatty and they had a nice, crisp skin while still having tender meat. If you're not in the mood for a soup dish, this would be my choice for sure. It's a great contrast to the wet, but not soggy, texture of the soup dishes that can get repetitive. Being able to split a soup and a pan fried dish with a friend or significant other really helps break up the monotony. Heck, compared to prices elsewhere in the city, you could just order both yourself and still be saving money. Food wise, everything was great. I highly recommend ordering the fried dumplings, the House Special #1 with Knife Cut Noodles and the Roast Duck Pan Fried Noodles with whichever noodles that seem interesting. Unfortunately, ambiance-wise, the dining area is very dingy. I'm tempted to suggest takeout, but I'm not sure how they would package the noodles with the soup and I'm worried if you have to travel longer than 5-10 minutes if the food would be soggy by the time you got home. I think I'm going to try this next time and I'll let everyone know how it goes."
0,"I was having one of those lazy sundays and was not about to leave my apartment or cook food. I had gotten a take out menu left under my door so i figured i would give it a shot. I decided on the chili burrito after much deliberation because everything looks so good. The food came really quickly and it even came with free chips and salsa! Score!! The burrito was delicious, the chips and and salsa were decent but you cant complain about free food. All in all i highly recommend at least their take out."
0,"What not to like? only maybe that they don`t deliver? Otherwise, as a vegetarian i rarely get satisfied with food at the places which are not vegetarian orientated, but here i found my fav veggie burger, it is juicy, it is a little spicy, just enough plus Yuca fries, yummy! I love even the buns that they use while i usually prefer not to eat buns at all. Desert section, tried it all, but of course, chocolate souffle is a winner. The salad with pomegranate seeds is delicious, we always order bacon on the side, so i can share it with my bf."
0,"I really don't enjoy writing bad reviews as to be honest, life is more fun when experiences are great and positive. Unfortunately Bouley win a new lowest of the low review for me. Again if I could give a zero rating, you'd get it Bouley. Having specifically told the restaurant when I booked a table well in advance it was to celebrate my wedding anniversary.  They cancelled my table the day before without a call to explain or even an email. It was only because I called to check my booking that I Found out. I made an official complaint and asked that the manager call me personally back. He/she deemed it not important enough. I'm sure the food is great, but this is the worst I have ever encountered in customer service and arrogance. Not even a token apology. Boyley is a disgrace and so ashamedly typical of today's supposed fine dining restauranteurs - if you want a nice dinner in NYC and it's a special occasion, please go elsewhere to avoid disappointment and being cancelled for clearly more important diners."
0,"great quality, fair prices, love to eat in the back garden area"
0,"this place is f*cking awesome. the food is delicious. but disgusting at the same time. i have had this place countless of times and it never fails to get me full. they have chicken, lamb, or combo plates with pita bread and lettuce. they also offer a gyro sandwiche thing which is good too. the white sauce is addicting. its like there is crack in there; i cannot get enough of it. it was great when i went at like 5am after a night of dancing at the club. the food taste even better at 5am after dancing all night to great music. yelp says they close at 4am, but fri and sat, i think they close around 5am, depending on the amount of people there."
1,Very good comfort food when you want good soul food without the restaurant preparation (sort of like mac and cheese or a grilled cheese sandwich for Americans).  I go for the kimchi bokkeum bop with the fried egg and two pieces of fried Spam.  Nothing says comfort food more than Spam!
0,"This is the first time in my life I have ever gotten food poisoning. Never again. I went with my boyfriend (who was lucky not to get sick). We ordered the Marinated Salmon Carpaccio, Hakata Sushi Roll, Gyoza, and Grilled Tonton Pork Belly. I'm not sure what did it, but I was sick all night, got less than two hours of sleep, and am still ill. Food poisoning aside, the service was slow, and it was rather hard to wave down any servers (even for water, which they did not serve us, or anyone, until we asked). Poor experience, and I would love a refund. Absolutely not worth the $100 I spent."
1,"My prayers have been answered by Sottocasa. This neighborhood was STARVING for some good Neapolitan pizza and this place really hits the spot. It's cozy with a great, simple vibe and the pizza is excellent. The backyard looks lovely and I'm sure I'll be back there a lot on sunny days, especially when they get their beer license. I'll definitely be back soon!"
1,We went there with my wife for a date night. It was a great experience: the place is nice and cozy (we got the window table!). Service and food were great. We keep this place for our special occasions!
0,"Came from Boston to eat here. Now I'm going to have to move to TriBeCa   The food and service and ambience were FABULOUS!!!!! There isn't a restaurant I haven't been to and I assure you this is amongst the best. Make sure to try the lobster pasta - it's incredible   I can't wait to eat here again. BTW the peeps there were incredible - Mr. Forgione, Miriam,  the general manager, just everyone!!!!!! Kudos!!!!"
1,"Ling L. reminded me to review this before we forgot! This is a small place located in Brooklyn.  Tables of dark wood with high stools, not the most comfortable for our group, but we were too large to sit at the smaller tables. Didn't get busy until well after it was dark outside... quiet night, I suppose. Fresh oysters to start on the half shell - nice and clean and done well. The fried zucchini appetizer was like fries, and they gave us some nice aged gouda on the house to try, too. Calamari was decent, but nothing special there. Tried the special sea bass dinner - not bad, a pretty stable, simple butter-based sauce and fresh asparagus. The clam sauce pasta wasn't bad. But it was filling, if a bit too salty. They did accommodate our big party of 10 pretty well, though. They were very friendly and timely with almost everything other than the water."
1,"Honestly, it's a little expensive for falafel, but you get what you pay for. $7-ish for a large falafel sandwich isn't something you can go wrong with (comparing to other falafel competitors in NYC). It was pretty good and seeing different flavors for falafel in a restaurant. Customer service was friendly and people served with a smile, plus the restaurant was very modern and did not look like it was run down compared to most run-of-the-joint middle eastern restaurants."
1,"I actually want to give them 3.5 stars. I used to go to Frankie's about once a week (sometimes once for dinner, once for brunch) for the past couple of years (my ex-boyfriend lives around the corner).  So, I've been here a lot.  My god it's frightening how much the Franks got from me (or, thankfully, my ex!)... I probably could have had a nice trip to the Maldives, considering the number of crostini, Vodka limeades, and prunes I've consumed at this place! Frankie's was spectacular as a neighborhood restaurant.  It was great to pop over and get a some crostini, a good salad, a great sandwich, and some decent wine.  Or for brunch, for the fabulous French toast.  But, as the Franks' star has risen, the dining experience just got progressively more frustrating with the crowds and the long waits.  Basically, yes, Frankie's serves very good, very solid food.  But it's not worth the crazy waits that their popularity have brought forth.   Over the many, many meals I've had at Frankie's, the food was always very consistently good.  And, the menu is also remarkably consistent.  They make some claim about local and seasonal, but there haven't been huge changes since 2005, when I first started eating there.  There have been a couple dishes that have been disappointing-- most often vegetarian pastas and occasionally salads-- but the menu and preparation is solid.   What's not consistent is the service.  The waitstaff can be extremely uneven.  Some are great, others rarely will refill glasses or ask if you want another drink (hello... um, please take my $12 for a glass of wine!), or leave you hanging at brunch when all you want is to get a cup of coffee asap before ordering.  And other mishaps.  These problems happen a lot more than they should considering the level Frankies is supposedly at. If they are seating in the garden when the weather is nice, or the carriage house, go there.  It's much nicer, although again, sometimes the service suffers out there. In all, I'd recommend hitting Frankie's for a weekday lunch, when it will be calm, and you can enjoy it.  Or go for a very late dinner, when the place has cleared out.  As much as I enjoy the avocado & beet salad, some of the crostini, and especially the lamb ragu, I wouldn't deal with the crowds or the attitude from 6-10 pm. NB, the French toast is better at Frankie's than at Prime Meats. They use different bread.  So, even if Frankie's is packed and there's space at Prime Meats, I'd rather wait for the Frankie's French toast."
1,"I'll start with the food: it was simply divine. I wasn't familiar with Turkish food before eating here, but I'm definitely a fan now. I think we got the vegetarian platter (my friend ordered for us). There wasn't a thing on that plate I wasn't completely in love with. Upon first glance, the portion looked deceivingly small. I wasn't sure if it was going to be enough food for the both of us but halfway through our meal, I was so stuffed, I thought the buttons on my dress were going to pop off! I think it was the bread that did it, I couldn't get enough of those heavenly warm pieces of savory perfection, each dipped into anyone of the mouthwatering spreads in front of me. The only sour note of our meal was one of their specials of the night, an appetizer made of fried zucchini topped with yogurt sauce. We ordered the supplement while enjoying our main course, and in comparison, the poor thing didn't stand a chance. It lacked any real flavor; it was mushy, oily and under seasoned. All in all, I had an amazing meal here last Friday night. We arrived around 8:00 pm, and from half a block away I could see a line of people waiting for a table. Apparently they have an upstairs seating area too, but despite the fact that there were seats available, it did not seem to be a popular option as most of us opted to keep waiting for a table downstairs instead. We got a table outside facing 81st rather than on the much busier 3rd Ave, which was fortunate as we were afforded a bit more privacy. Every aspect of the ambiance was lovely, from the beautifully designed blue and white glass tabletops to the planted live flowers that created a sort of whimsical fence between the tables and the rest of the street, I was enchanted with the charm of this restaurant."
0,"Came here for brunch.  After all the hype about the Black Label burger, I had to try it.  I won't say it was the best burger I ever had, as some people do, but it definitely delivered and I left satisfied.  I actually appreciated that it wasn't too big and didn't make me feel like I wanted to be rolled out of the place after devouring the burger and plate of fries (which were also delicious).  Easily in the top tier for burgers, but $26 is just too much.  If it were clearly the best one I'd ever had I'd say fine, but there are a lot of great burgers for much less.  And the service also wasn't the best.  So 5 stars for taste, and minus 1 for value and service."
1,"Dear Manager, I will not return until you hire proper help. Yes, there's a lot of interest in your restaurant because of the location and that fantastic view, but your staff is going to un-manage this place to death. So many people standing around doing nothing. Such a long wait for food. Such a poor table turn-around. There was a 1-hour wait when we left, and at that point the tables were half-empty on the top floor. Fire some waiters and the pointless 'hostesses' and hire some chefs! Then I might return."
0,"After having dinner there with friends last night, Mayfield is now on my short-list of best restaurants in Crown Heights. The food is inventive without being fussy. Really enjoyed the grilled octopus with pork belly. The crisp smoked pork contrasted beautifully with the tender octopus. The fluke ceviche featured wonderfully fresh fish ""cooked"" to a perfect consistency, bathed in a bright citrus marinade. The duck confit salad, accented with bits of duck liver, was another surprise that worked really well. And my wife's pork chop was tasty and tender with a not-too-sweet smoky glaze, lightly charred and delicious. To top it all off the staff was prompt and helpful. Mayfield is a great place to eat."
0,"Decline and Fall: When the south side of Williamsburg was still terra incognito this place was an outpost of quality. Hipster creep has since caught up with South Williamsburg (despite the efforts of the orthodox Hassidic community to keep the 'artists' on the other side of Broadway). It is now way overblown and the last two times we've been there they can't seem to even do the simple things right any longer. Last week I ordered one of their mainstays, the egg and cheese on a biscuit. After a twenty five minute wait it finally arrived. Unfortunately it was not worth the wait.  The egg/cheese portion of the formula was salty to the point of wondering if the cap on the salt shaker had fallen off during preparation. The poached egg breakfast entre was OK, although sometimes the combinations of what you find under the eggs are quite inedible. For our money the best breakfast in Williamsburg is actually in Greenpoint at Le Gamin."
0,"My husband and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here back in June. The food & their service was superb and everyone had a wonderful time. So we went back again with our friends last month, this time for a small group dinner. The appetizers (calamari, tartar, baby octopus) were just okay. Nothing really stood out. I've had better dishes at some of the other restaurants in NYC (Park Avenue Winter, Eleven Madison Park, Acme, illili, Nomad, Quality Meats, just to name a few). Our friend and I had the Grilled Lamb T-bone & Ribs with marinated wild mushrooms, red Russian kale, turnips & beluga lentils. Unfortunately, I had to send the dish back. Our waiter, who was very attentive, offered us another dish but we just did not want another salty dish with really bad meat. I never turn back my food at any restaurant so I was very upset as well. I was only able to eat the kale and the rest were just too salty. Lamb was definitely overcooked & we could not even slice the meat since it was chunky, lumpy and hard. Probably the worst lamb dish I've ever had. It was simply not eatable. I politely told the manager about our situation and he indicated that he will instruct the kitchen staff. I never write negative reviews here, but it was so terrible I just had to. Again, we had an AMAZING time with 20+ wedding guests for our rehearsal dinner so I know they are capable of making things better."
1,"I am not sure quite why but this place just seemed OK. I am not from NY, so maybe I just didn't get it. 2 slices of Lasagna pizza for $8- can't beat it! The pizza was loaded with meat and cheese. I am a big eater, and one was more than enough to feed me and I was hungry. Small walk in place- maybe 5 stools and a couple of tables outside. Nothing fancy if you are dressed up for a show. I will try a different place next time I am in NY."
1,"Food was good, but service was sub-par. When we were seated the cutlery hadn't been washed and our server asked repeatedly if we were ready for the check while we were still clearly eating. There are a ton of other great places in that neighborhood."
0,"The space occupied by The Spotted Pig is decently furnished but hardly anything memorable. It at times reminds me of a generic Paul Smith location. At the door, I was ignored until one of the rude staff members noticed me and directed me to a table. Although there were plenty of tables available, he showed me to a tiny one located right in front of the kitchen (and hence uncomfortably noisy). Over the course of the meal, I came to the conclusion that the Spotted Pig only hires employees who are slow, surly, and seemingly hard of hearing. Service was, in other words, absolutely atrocious. I ordered the chargrilled burger & shoestring fries because that is what they're supposedly known for. It arrived after 40 minutes and was not at all impressive. The meat tasted funny and the fries were almost impossible to eat (a mess). Leaving most of the burger untouched, I paid the tab and could not be happier to leave. In a nutshell-- don't believe the hype and STAY AWAY!"
1,"We came here for brunch on Mother's Day at 12:30 PM. The wait for a table of 4 was not too bad for a place this size. We ordered the buttermilk pancakes, baked eggs, and French toast. The pancakes were the best! The were fluffy with a crusty exterior. Never had pancakes like that. Did not get super soggy and fall apart in syrup my four-year old drowned them in."
0,"I'd been yearning for more of their biscuits n gravy since pies n thighs closed; went today and had a dining experience that wouldn't have made me such a fan had I been served the same meal a couple years ago. I was very surprised at how small the portions are. The biscuits n gravy were half the portion they were at the old location. And at $8 they don't include any sides. The pie slices are tiny as others said. The sides portions were small too. I was still hungry walking out their door. Back to the biscuits & gravy, the dish was cold and not as flavorful as it used to be. I think their printed menu and pricing  needs rethinking. If they want to do an a la carte menu (like Turkish or tapas places) because that's what the menu really is, you have to choose and buy separately your sides, then they should just do that. Instead we go in expecting to be filled up and we weren't so it's a letdown."
1,"I've been hearing about this place for so long that I was pretty thrilled to find out I was in the neighborhood last night. The sauce list was a little overwhelming, so I decided to go simple - the free especial sauce (mayo, ketchup, onion) and the black truffle mayo. Two friends and I split the smallest cone, which was still enormous. The truffle sauce was so truffle-y, with that hint of spice that makes it great, and the especial sauce was a perfect match for the fries and my ultimate favorite. Things were pretty crammed in there, but the line moved quick. Such a novelty that I'm not sure I'd return, but I'm glad I went."
0,"On a recent trip to New York City, I used Yelp to try to find a good Mexican dinner at the last minute. I am so glad that I chose based on the reviews because this was exactly what we wanted. Thought it's not a traditional American Mexican restaurant, it's still fantastic. A quaint, intimate restaurant that offers a small menu, but delicious food was the perfect place for a cozy dinner. I also thought it was a good value for the price of both the food and the wine. Would love to come back again for brunch."
0,"If you're into chicken, this is the place to go to.  I went with my wife to this place from a friend's recommendation.  I usually don't go out of my way to eat chicken in a restaurant since my wife is actually a mean chicken cook!  Anyway, I went with the chicken burger and was really pleased.  I had it with mac and cheese and it was such a great comfort meal.  It was raining outside the night we went which made the food taste even better. My wife had some chicken thigh dish that was even better than mine. I made her share it with me.  I was really surprised with how moist they got the chicken to taste.  Of course, I had to tell my lady that her chicken was still better although I was really lying."
1,"French Fries? WRONG! Belgian fries is more like. Jean Claude Van Damme ain't got CRAP on these bad boys. This is a tiny hole in the wall establishment, that serves ONLY these heart-clogging fries with a many many sauces. For the price you pay (about 6-8 dollars, can't really recall), you get a bunch of fries that are fresh and hot from the oil. And I do mean hot; be careful you don't burn your precious tongue! The sauces are the other stars of the show. Pomegranate teriyaki is my personal favorite, while the mango chutney everyone raves about is not to my liking. BUT, I'm almost sure this place has at least ONE sauce with which you will fall in love. These sauces are a dollar each or something, but they provide more than enough to accompany one order of fries. The place itself is nothing to write home about - potato sacks lining the walls, and two tables + bar stool seating. Each space at the tables/bar has a hole in the table so you could put your conical order of fries in them. HOW FREAKIN' SWEET IS THAT?!"
1,Place is amazing.. the Nutella Pizza dessert is ridiculous!!!!!! love it
1,"When this place first arrived in the neighbourhood, I was so sure that it was going to be a hipster-infested nightmare. However... I have to give credit where credit is due. They're fantastic... in every way, drinks, food, service. Everything I've had there has been delicious. The food always tastes fresh, the drinks are always perfectly concocted and the waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive. My personal recommendations... their hangar steak has never disappointed for an entree, as well as their burger. Their cheese plate is a fantastic starter and can easily fill you up for the night, if that's what you're looking for. Their truffle fries are also heavenly (even if they make the fat rolls on your stomach budge right out). Get their gelato as a finishing touch to the meal. The flavours change daily, but they've always been quite tasty. Just be warned: Unless you go super early or super late, you will likely be waiting for a table. Avoid on the weekends, because you can be waiting for an hour or two if you come in the middle of the afternoon. They seem to have everything working for them."
0,"I read the NY Times article on Dos Toros and was intrigued. I can't state that I am a taqueria aficienado and frankly I don't really understand notion of a San Francisco burrito. What I do understand is good food. Now I must confess to enjoying Chipolte's burritos - they are filling and tasty - really hit the spot. At least that was the case until my travels took me to Dos Toros down by Union Square. WOW. Great carnitas that melts in your mouth, steak burrito that actually tastes like steak (no mystery meat here), hot sauce with zing, and guacamole that is neither too chunky nor too smooth. I have traveled throughout the Americas and can easily state that Dos Toros offers the real deal at a price that won't break your wallet. Wish they served sangria."
0,Best grilled calamari I have ever had!
1,"Great tasting lunch place. If you are looking for very spicy Indian food, however, you might not be as pleased.  I didn't think the India roll upgrade would make much of a difference but after i accidentally ordered it I haven't switched back to regular rolls since.  The extra dollar per roll is worth it. ORDER FOR PICKUP. There is always a long line and unless you want to wait 15 minutes to order then wait for another 10 to get it, the pickup option is best for you."
1,"Let me just preface this by saying that I avoid the midtown area at all costs outside of work. It's too crowded, too many tourists, and just too messy. that being said, i WILL travel to Room Service if I am in the mood for Thai. This is my go to thai restaurant in the city. I've only ever gotten the Room Service Pad Thai (don't forget to ask for the dried shrimp!!) here but its amazing every single time. I've been to Bangkok multiple times and from what I can remember, the pad thai here is actually super authentic. Also, the decor is pretty cool- really dark but in a good way. The drinks here are also superb. I'm a sucker for anything sweet. I don't remember the name of the drink I usually get here but its some sort of Lychee cocktail. Anyways, if you find yourself in hells kitchen and craving Thai food, this is most definitely the place to hit up!!"
1,"When I first came here a year ago, I liked it a lot. It had (and still has) a pretty chill slash casually romantic vibe, somehow even when it's busy on a Friday night. It's a good spot to meet up with friends or a date, with a nice beer selection and a quick & easy walk from the 30th Ave N/Q station. When I came back for dinner and drinks this past weekend, I was a little disappointed. The fried pickles were soggy, as if the pickles were thrown into the fryer with way too much pickle juice still on them. Or maybe they just weren't fried long enough? Either way, they didn't impress. Also, the mac&cheese that seems to get solid reviews wasn't cheesy enough for my taste, though I liked the texture otherwise. I did like my Murphy's Irish Stout and the rest of the beer menu looked good, too! Cocktails are okay - nothing very delicious but also not unfairly priced. I'd say it's worth a visit if you're already on the N/Q or just looking for drinks, but if you want drinks + food there are better locales in the area."
1,"Live on the block and love this place. Thank god for great coffee, fresh juice, and good bites. Not to mention the nicest guys running it and the welcoming cool decor."
0,"I LOVE this place! I'm a vegetarian and sometimes it's hard to find good ,tasty ,healthy food,well i absolutely found it at ""The Hummus & Pita Co""!! First of all the people that worked there are very nice and helpful ,they explained how the food is prepared and what the ingredients were.I chose the pita(which are baked there) and i had it filled with the most appetizing  ,grilled vegtables and flavored hummus,morroccan beans,beet salad and spanish eggplant...it was STUFFED:)) I also LOVED the sweet potato fries,they were so fresh and tasty..i can't wait to go back and try the Laffa:) The pricing  is excellent..good n CHEAP!!  and  the 1 train is on the corner( i take the 1 train ,but , the F is also there)On a scale of 1-10 i'm giving it a 10+ !!!"
0,Absolutely loved this place. The food was great and so was the service.
1,"Cozy, busy, delicious. Arrived at 7 on Saturday and had no wait to sit. Pitchers of sangria are a deal at 23 bucks. Fantastic food and friendly service. The olives are amazing. Had calamari (bit greasy but excellent sauce), peppers stuffed with creamy crab on crostini (delicious), and duck sausage with quail eggs and pearl onions (good but not enough onion to balance it all out). Looking forward to going back and trying some other things."
1,"This is one of my favorite spots in the city... One of the owners is almost always there and it shows.  The vibe is a perfect mix of rustic (worn, dark-wood tables/bar/chairs/floor against exposed red brick walls) and swank (sparkly chandeliers dropped from a steel paneled ceiling) and hip (interesting photography along the brick wall hung from a wire line with clothing clips) and quaint (antique-looking mismatched tableware, some of which I'm sure I remember seeing at my grandparents house growing up)... The food is all fresh and light.  The wine selection is small but very good and well-priced."
1,"Nook is such a great little ""nook"" in Hell's Kitchen. The entire restaurant has about 8 tables. I took my sister to Nook for her birthday and everything was delicious! I recommend the mushroom cigars, Tuscan Chicken and Steak Frites. We split it all. The warm apple pie was divine and I don't even have a sweet tooth! Plus, its byob!"
1,"4 stars? What the heck?! Customer service sucked. First the guy started to argue when I asked for a tuna melt on rye, I guess they make it on a pita. Just make me my sandwich, malaka! OK, so I ordered a grilled cheese. They didnt ask me what kind of bread or cheese. The white bread was stale, and the cheese was processed. An elderly African American man walked in, and the cook begins to loudly berate him, basically calling him a looser, totally not necessary. So the food was mediocre, and they dont know how to take an order. They are also gross. When I walked in they were piling garbage bags on the dining counter! Shortly afterward a lady walked in and sat in the same spot and they didnt even wipe down the counter! This place is kinda nasty and pretty sad."
1,"For the Chelsea Art District --pretty awesome piggy in my belly, but not quite a modern masterpiece."
1,"nearly 1,000 reviews and almost 5 stars?? that's impressive. now, there's much unecessary confusion to this halal cart and which is the ""correct"" one.  i'm still not sure if i ate at the right one or not. the website says they're only there from 730pm till 4am. however someone told me just to look for the yellow bags. i ate there at 4pm or so(there's two at opposite corners, we went to the one with the yellow bags).  this person's blog confirmed that story.  midtownlunch.com/2007/11… even with all this confusion, the food was awesome, so even if it wasn't the right one, i don't care. i'm betting that if i do go during the correct hours, it'll taste exactly the same."
0,"Please do not waste your time and money here. The beer was warm and tasted bad. My po' boy was made with cheap, tasteless, and stale bread. There was coleslaw all over it, which added no flavor and just made a mess. The ""blackened"" catfish was not blackened at all, because it was not spiced nearly enough. I've had a lot of blackened fish in the south and this was nothing like that. It was tasteless and had a pronounced gross fish flavor, like fish gone bad. The sandwich was just a sloppy, watery, tasteless mess. I could make WAY better at home. The gumbo tasted like it was made with a spice mix. It had that flat, fake flavor i remember from beef ramen flavoring pouches. And the shrimp was so overcooked, it no longer bore any resemblance to food item I am such a fan of. I'm sorry Catfish, but you really need to up your game. Your food is not just not good, it's actually bad."
0,"The ambiance and décor are nice - 4 stars. Food and service are ok - 3 stars. Price is very good; lunch special is a deal. I could give 3.5 stars, but I upgraded a little because this place is a to-go place among all these thai restaurants in 9th avenue, mainly due to décor and size. I would give 4 stars comfortably if there was a little bit more personal attention which is hard to find in Thai restaurants in this area."
1,"I had heard a lot about this place, and the food was good, but I don't think that it was worth the really long wait time and the less-than-stellar service. Plus, don't even think about going to the bathroom.  There's only one, so there was a huge line for it when I tried to go.  Then three different members of the waitstaff hollered at me to get out of the way when I was waiting on line for it.  I would have liked to stay and try the dessert but I had to leave so I could go elsewhere to use the restroom."
1,"Food was okay, but I was expecting much more (in taste and portions), especially for the price. I was really excited to try one of the Momofuku restaurants and it was the one ""nicer restaurant"" that I had chosen for a recent weekend trip to nyc. I got to try the pork buns, chawanmushi, and quail dish. I would recommend the first two, but not the quail - it was pretty tasteless. I'm not going to say that no one should ever go here, but based on my experience, I probably won't return. No hard feelings or anything, just unimpressed."
1,Best cheese grits ever...
1,Everything we ordered was fresh and tasted great! Lovely ambiance and great service. Will return!
1,Their ramen broth is the best I have had.  I have been to them in Japan as well.  Their noodles are just so so.  Too damn soft.  Appetizers are all great.  I can't see waiting on line here anymore unless I get a craving.  Might have to sneak in Stetagaya cold noodles in with me next time.
1,"I have to say that this place has gone downhill. I tried the sizzling seafood platter tonight, and I was sorely disappointed. First of all, it was not sizzling. It consisted of rubbery scallops, squid, and shrimp, which were also uncleaned. The mushrooms were canned.  The sauce seemed to consist solely of pepper and cornstarch. For the price, I felt that it should have come with rice.  The lemon iced tea was good but was about 75% ice."
1,good brunch. It make sense for the long line on the weekends.
0,"Unique Pizza! As my quest to find the best pizza in NYC. I came across Paulie Gee's A very dark atmosphere. Opens at 6pm- anyway, the have unique pizza creations in here. I haven't try all the combos yet. But I am pretty close. Went there a couple of times already and enjoy it. It is like naan bread with toppings on it. Is the best way to describe it. The pizzas that I like are Grapeful Dead and hellboy which happens to be my favorite. Paulie Gee the owner of the place, walk around and ask you how is everything? He is very friendly and we chat will all the customers that dine in. This is # 2 on my list on Pizza of best in NYC. Ask for the Mexican Coke. It is made with real cane sugar and not high fructose corn syrup."
1,"Meat. And more meat. Oh and some sides. One of which contains... meat. They're not messing around at this place. It's a carnivore's delight. Some highlights for me: 1.  You can order a sandwich or have the meat on its own (naked). So if you're going low-carb or paleo, this is now your happy place. Actually, the buns looked somewhat large, so I'd recommend going naked and saving room for all that meat. 2. You can choose your slaw - mayo or vinegar based. I tried the vinegar one and it was crunchy and delicious. 3. The side of beans with the burnt ends added in? Yes. Order it."
1,Great food and excellent service by Christy. Can tell they are making every effort to make the dining experience enjoyable. Will be back for many times.
0,cool guys and great food
1,"Enjoyed a late night dinner here with my brother after just arriving in NYC.  It was 1am and the joint was quite busy with diners (not just drinkers) giving credence to the notion that this city never sleeps.  Great pub atmosphere with exposed brick and a nice warm, charming feel. After slight sticker shock at the $17 price tag on the burger (this is NY after all) I proceeded to relax and enjoy the experience of America's first Gastropub.  This was quite possibly the very best burger I have ever had and was nicely accompanied by shoestring fries that were just fantastic with their subtle taste of garlic & rosemary.  All of this washed down with a properly poured pint of Guinness.  The only drawback was the beer selection...I was expecting just a little more in this department as I was hoping to try an east coast craft brew that I'm unable to get my hands on in the Northwest where I am from. Overall I would highly recommend."
1,"Great back patio! Good food. If you're just looking for coffee, go to lil skips instead."
0,"the food is great so I want to give them 4 stars but they are overpriced for the sake of being overpriced (100 dollar paella anyone?). Yes, we've had a Cyndi Lauper sighting there, and yes, it's the restaurant that gave some credibility to Brooklyn's 5th Avenue (park slope) restaurant row in the late 80s but times change and I think this place is about overdue. I'm going to try one of the many Manhattan Blue Ribbon locations before I go back here."
1,"This place is a complete hole in the wall masterpiece of french fries with crazy dipping sauces. If you are a french fry sauce kind of person, go to St Marks for Pommes Frites. I had one order of fries with 3 sauces. There was a SMOKED EGGPLANT MAYO, was one of my fav's!!! A HONEY MUSTARD MAYO, which was alright but nothing too crazy, and also the PINEAPPLE MAYO, which had a tart but super yummy texture. If you feel like going out with some friends to enjoy a relaxing evening of great company, GO THERE! ENJOY!"
0,"The dumplings were pretty much amazing, and the prices make them a steal.  We fed 4 people lunch for 5 dollars!"
1,"My God, this place gets really packed. I mean REALLY packed. You have to come here early, or else you'll wait forever. Everything I've had here is great, except for the ice cream sandwich. It's just... ok. We ended up sending one back because it was freezer burnt. Not worth it. However, as you would expect from all of the 5 star reviews, the meatballs here kick ass. I always get the special. There's always something crazy on the specials menu. If you can get in, check this place out."
1,"my stomach is on fire!  i should have listen to hundreds of yelpers warning all the newbiers to be easy on the hot sauce.  I thought to myself...how bad could it be?  Oh man, it's still burning as I'm writing this review. I can't think of any better way to spend a $6 meal than this joint's chicken and lamb combo with rice, pita and lettus.  The white sauce is a must and you should go easy on the hot sauce (unless you like feeling miserable).   This combo has your proteins, carbs and vegetables so you feel like you had a balanced meal (though i'm not sure if i really want to know the nutrition facts).  This is an unforgettable dish.  I enjoyed every bite till the end.  If you are visiting NYC, this is a must visit for a late night.  If you are in NYC and you never had it, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?  Since they are open till 4AM, call up few friends and let's get moving.   Few tips: Though the line is always long, don't be discouraged.  It moves fairly quickly.  Bring your own drinks since they don't sell any unless you wanna buy it from the cart 70 feet from this halal cart."
0,"Hearing a lot of great things about this place i had a lot of high hopes. With that said, the fries were good but the line to get in was ridiculous and the place was wayy to tiny to sit and enjoy, don't even know why they even bother to have a seating area. Sauces were pretty good, loved the variety and the fact they let me try the sauces even with a 100 people behind waiting lol."
0,"I opened a yelp account just to give this place a review. This family owned quaint restaurant is fantastic; great food and excellent service. I was here a couple of times with friends. The KAMAYAN Night (eating with your hand) is awesome; consists of three baskets - basket of entrees, basket of noodles and basket of salted duck eggs, tomatoes and mangoes. The Karaoke was so much fun. We had a great time. The second time I was here, my friends & I ordered a la carte. We had Laing, Kalderetang baka (beef stew in tomato sauce), Tinolang Manok (chicken in ginger broth), Fried Milkfish & Sitaw & Kalabasa (long beans & squash). Everything that we had was so good! I particularly liked the Kalderetang baka (Beef stew), it was cooked in perfect softness and the gravy, sooo yummy! Great food, fantastic service and fun!!! We'll definitely go back again with friends!!!"

0,"My partner and I spent a week in NYC in late May this year.  The Ear Inn was the first place we went for a drink after getting in to our B&B in Canal Street.  Michael made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived.  After a 20 hour flight from Melbourne it was great to be somewhere we felt comfortable in.  We made it our local and over the week we were in NYC we went plenty of times.  Its a cool relaxed bar with great Jazz, good food and a terrific attitude. Not to be missed."
0,"Completely obsessed with this place! I just had lunch here and the pork sandwich was perfection. The ambiance is great, the staff is super friendly and the food is amazing. I will definitely be returning. Can't wait to try out their happy hour special!"
1,"Until very recently, I lived less than a block away from Flat Top, and, fortunately for my gut, I moved a few blocks farther away a few days before they opened! I went for the first time last night, and went again tonight. And I'm not usually one to eat at the same place two nights in a row! Last night, I had a market salad, duck, and a peanut butter and jelly sundae. The market salad is exactly what you'd want from a market salad. The duck dish is smart and delicious, and the duck breast itself was among the most tender I've had. I wasn't expecting all of the components (udon noodles, lemon beurre blanc [which, to me, seems a lighter, more delicate relative of Alfredo--not of Kraft, as another reviewer said]) to harmonize well, but they absolutely did. The peanut butter and jelly sundae is one of the best desserts I've had in the past year, period. Tonight, I had mushroom risotto, striped bass, and (again, of course) a peanut butter and jelly sundae. The risotto was heavenly, and I'll find it difficult not to order the bass on future visits to Flat Top. It seems to me that Flat Top's chef is uninterested in the kind of culinary over-complication that passes for originality and often leads to soullessness in food. This said, the food at Flat Top is far from ""simple""--although the ingredients are mostly familiar ones, they're used in strikingly thoughtful and exciting ways. I'll bet that soon enough, it will be hard to get a seat for dinner without making a reservation well in advance. So go now."
1,"Consistent.  We've eaten here a good 20 times since we've been living in the UWS in NYC, and we've been pleased with the food and service.  The empanadas are VERY flavorful and some of the best we've had, the green sauce is just awesome..  Chicken Pio is must order for us along with the avocado salad.  Delivery is super fast for us, we live within 10 blocks."
1,"Ok... I admit... I have a problem... I spend too much money on coffee...   Discovering nice little coffee shop like Little Collins doesn't help curbing my addiction to coffee....  Its a nice quaint coffee house on the way down from my GF apt. to work.  It seems a bit out-of-place being in the middle of the hustle and bustle of midtown east smack middle of tall office buildings and corporate offices.   We often stop by in the morning  for their coffee and banana nut bread.   We are always greeted warmly.   They seem to put a lot of care into brewing their coffee and it shows in their brew.  It's one exceptional brew.  Has just the right amount of caffeine to wake me up and not feel too jittery.  It is most definitely better than other options around the area. Come for the coffee, friendly atmosphere and wonderful baked goods."
1,"Waited 2 hours in the cold for some delicious ramen; ughhhh, so good."
0,"Love their panini:) liked their dessert, Panna Cotta."
1,This is the birth place of NewYork Style Pizza and America's first licensed Pizzeria.  Located in a old red brick building. The walls were filed with lots of news articles and pictures of their 110 years of history. Bit loud and small. The service was fast and appreciable. Me n my friend ordered a half Margherita-half White and Mama's Meatballs. The later were awesome and delightful. The pizza was half god with the Margherita and somehow both of us didn't like the white style. Felt too bland. Only Cash Accepted.
0,"I'd never heard of Mark Simmons until I read these reviews. I agree with the reviewer who said that reviews mentioning Mark Simmons (except this one) should be discounted 100%. Based on the meal we had there, this guy simply does not know how to cook. Worth a trip just to see how far off yelp reviews can be. We had omelettes, bubble and squeak and a scone. The scone was good, the other two items had absolutely no taste. The omelette had broccoli and cheese. It also supposedly had some brussels sprouts leaves or something. I was able to tell it had cheese it in because it was on the menu and I could see some in the omelette but I couldn't taste it at all. The broccoli was undercooked. The portions were small. The overall experience was of someone who doesn't know how to cook taking the idea of an omelette and the idea of making food ""light"" and delivering something that isn't actually a dish. It looked like one of those plastic dishes you see in restaurant windows in Japan, and tasted like it looked. Two stars for the decor and very good service. Music is pretty cool too."
1,"My friends from Cali love this place.  This always the first place they make reservations for when they visit.  They insist that this is their favorite restaurant in the world... I'm not sure it's my favorite restaurant in the whole wide world, but it comes close.   I've eaten everything on the menu here at one time or another.  Highly recommend the duck confeit and the French onion soup."
0,"One of my favorite New York restaurants. It can get very busy, but the service is always excellent, and dishes delicious. Eating in the garden out back is always a break from the hectic city life."
1,"I met some friends here, to watch the Brazil-Camaroon World Cup game.  They had the game on several screens and a good time was had by all. The pizza was delicious, the mixed drinks were excellent, and the staff was friendly and attentive.  I will be back, for the welcoming atmosphere, and great  pizza, even when there is no special event to view."
0,"For the price, this place can't be beat. Their $1 fried dumplings is really tasty. I don't recommend the boiled version, or their vegetable dumplings. The veggie dumplings in soup was especially nasty - they were a bit heavy with the white pepper. The pancakes are also another hidden treasure. They're best fresh out of the pot, with vegetables. The beef with veggie pancakes is good too. And plain, it's a dirt cheap 50c for an extremely filling, tasty fried dough. Their soybean milk drink is pretty thin. I wouldn't pay 50c for it, let alone a dollar. This place is SMALL. There's barely room for anyone to sit."
1,octopus salad is my favorite. flavorful and well balanced. love the lamb burger but must say it's a little big ! the orange spiced feta is a perfect addition and the bun is nice and hard on the outside and soft on the inside.  these are also one of my favorite smashed fries I've ever had. we held a large party at their other location and everything we tried was perfect. on ditmars there are a lot of Greek restos to choose from. you will not go wrong if you go here!!
1,"Verlaine has a cozy atmosphere which I just love. It gets really crowded as it gets later, but if you already have a good spot then it does not matter.  Unless you leave, then there is no way your going to get your seat back.   Service was great and the bartenders were very attentive.  Always asking if I want another drink when I was finished with mine even when the place was packed.   Overall I would definitely come back here, the lychee martini is good!"
0,"This place was fine, but very much overhyped. I came with a couple of girlfriends for brunch. The server was very distracted and not-too helpful. I had a breakfast scramble, and it was unimpressive. Not terrible, but far from memorable, or even good. Pretentious crowd, even for Chelsea."
1,"This place is so full of so much win. Starting from cozy atmosphere, to the wonderful service, and finally the most important piece, the food! If this is your first time here, start with the soft warm pretzel with two amazing spreads. Next order the Katja's Ruben, which consists of pork belly, cabbage, cheese, pickles, and mustard! This sandwich is very rich but they cut it into several pieces so its a great dish to share amongst friends. The last thing I tried was the bratwurst over sauwerkraut. I love my bratwurst so this was a winner for me too. I can't wait to come back to try the Austrian meatballs, goulash, and sausage sampler!"
1,"I have now been here 3 times in less than one week.  I need to diversify my choices, but have only gotten the green pesto sandwich.  It is SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!"
0,"What sets this bar apart from most is that the bartenders are really friendly and interactive with the customers. It means a lot when you go back to the place, they remember you, they remember your name, and greet you with a handshake and a smile. The place is very nice and the doors in front open up to let the nice cool air in (which is a nice little perk if you have a bar seat by those doors -- and yes, the place has air-conditioning if you don't :) Just a very nice experience all around the couple of times I've been there. I'll def. be going back."
0,"New opening. Great soup dumplings. They have the regular pork and crab meat, but got to try the super spicy, wasabi  and chocolate one which I can't find anywhere else . The entrees are not bad too, love their crispy beef and fresh fillet in chili pepper oil. We have to go back and try other dishes. Overall moden decor, spacious and good food."
1,"I went to this place on a whim, I always pass by and its always packed. The meat was very tasty. I wished it had more sides in the buffet area. The four stars is for the quality of food. I would given 5 however I didnt like that the food is weighed. I thought it was a bit pricy for two people."
0,A couple of friends and I ate there last night and it was terrific.  Absolutely loved the food and the service was exceptional.  What can I say even the prices were right.  We can't wait to go back and see the Flamenco show.
1,"This place is a hidden gem!  I went to dinner at The Queens Kickshaw last night and I was totally blown away.  I started with the ""Queso"" appetizer (a cheese and beer blend fondue with home-made tortilla chips) and the flavor was complex and delicious.  For dinner I had the ""Kitchen Sink Salad"" and it was AMAZING- there was different lettuces, pickled vegetables including asparagus and pickled cherries, quail egg, and feta cheese on top.  The portion was huge and the flavor was incredible.  I also had a special hard cider that was on tap and it was delicious.  The selection of beers, hard ciders, and wine is amazing.  My friend had the Wild Mushroom Shepherds Pie and she said it was fantastic.  If you want super fresh, homemade food made with love in a relaxed and cool atmosphere- definitely try this place!!"
0,"horrible i think that day they spilled the spice container on it, i like halal once in awhile , but that day was just over spiced i needed a two liter soda."
1,"This place so adorable! Came for brunch around 3 (they serve until five!). I got a specialty drink - the chili margarita and it was delicious - and the steak and eggs. It's super cozy, reasonably priced, and I'd definitely go back. The only thing was the service a little slow (as reflected in other reviews). We felt a little forgotten towards the end of our meal. Otherwise, I'm a fan!"
0,"Celebrated a birthday with couple of friends.  The décor was plain and on the cold side.  Staff acted polite but lukewarm.  Food was pretty good, but not worth the money."
0,5 stars for taste 2 stars for wait time.   Jeeeeeezus worth it though ;)
1,"Unfortunately, I did not get to try the food, because when we arrived, the hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait. After walking around the neighborhood, we checked in an hour later, only to learn that it would be another 45 minutes! I don't mind waiting, but I have never been told a wait time that is half the time of the actual wait. Gr. Also, I had a cappuccino that was very disappointing -- way too much foam in too big of a cup (even though I ordered a small!). The blueberry muffin was pretty good.. and the only reasons I gave two stars (rather than one) . I hope I have the opportunity to try this restaurant again, and receive a more accurate wait time description :)"
1,Damn. We've walked past this place for quite a while and only recently tried it. A solid pizza joint and welcomed addition to our little universe of neighborhood restaurants. Great chewy crust on these pizzas. Flavorful ingredients. Friendly folks running the place. I've forgotten all about that Lucali place now.
1,"They have great soup dumplings here and we always just come for the dumplings. I'd suggest coming outside of lunch/dinner hours to avoid the line, but if you really must, go during lunch hour. The turnover is quicker and people tend to linger less. Also, be prepared to eat with other people. Unless you are lucky enough to snag a small table, you'll be seated at a larger table with other parties. The trick is to not look at them while you're eating. Haha!"
1,"My go-to place for a good burger.  The food is organic and the fries and onion rings (which come with like 8 sauces) are made with peanut oil.  You leave satisfied, not overly full like you do at other burger joints.  It is a great summer lunch or dinner spot!"
0,"On day we spontaneously got inside this place and had the Italian meat & cheese. it was so fresh and  authentic, and the Italian meat was the best that i've ever had in new york city so far.   I don't mind tiny table and standing for eating as long as food is that delicious."
1,"There's quite a bit of hype about this place. I gotta say for a crowded, somewhat small restaurant on the LSE chock full of hipsters with ironic t-shirts its actually a pretty nice, welcoming atmosphere. The service was good, I hunched over at the bar counter and a friendly dude dished me up some quasi-cuban treats. I asked him what the popular dishes are and told him I was thinking about the mole enchiladas and he actually said thats his least fav cuz its a non-chocolate mole (its specified on the menu as well). This was good to know since I was definitely wondering how the mole would be without the chocolate. He even went further to let me know the chef is a diabetic so thats why he cooks up a different preparation of it. I gotta say, anytime a server is actually honest with you and doesn't just try to push any dish you ask about, I'm impressed. And if you're a diabetic, rock on with the low sugar mole. I ordered the pulled pork dish. It seemed relatively authentic and everyone else seemed to be chowing down on it so i figured it might be the main deal here. Okay, so I wasn't blown away. I really wanted some sauce or something on the pulled pork...it looked and tasted very fresh but it was a little more on the bland side. On the upside, it wasn't too salty like a lot of carnitas dishes tend to be at shitty restaurants. The rice was seasoned fine and it also came with black beans. Overall, for over 10 bucks I expect more. I really wish I got the corn, since everyone has been raving about it, but I was definitely full by that point. I will also say I ordered a margarita on the rocks and he gave me a nice heavy pour in a big glass. Honestly this guy kinda earned it the extra star, otherwise I woulda given it 3. That drink was the best value at 7.50. But I will go back again and try the corn and see if I can get a carnitas burrito or the steak enchiladas since they're supposed to be good. As far as the ironic t-shirts, the bartender's was for a plumbing company...really dude? you work for a plumbing company? I thought you were the barten-- ohhh I see what you did there you clever dog."
1,"The outdoor seating is great on a beautiful day. I highly recommend sitting here because the inside smelled stale and stuffy when I walked through. Unfortunately, after months of wanting to try this place, I was left disappointed. Boyfriend and I shared a roast chicken/mozzarella/arugula panini and the avocado/mozzarella/mushroom/black pepper panini. The chicken was terrible...dry, chewy, and smothered with spicy mayo. It left much to be desired, especially because I still have fond memories of amazing chicken paninis elsewhere. The avocado panini was better but the only thing I could really taste was the overabundance of black pepper. For paninis, I would still go to Press 195. There was nothing wrong with this place, but it definitely didn't live up to the hype on Yelp."
0,"I've got to say, ever since I first started coming here 3 years ago, it's quickly become one of my favorite spots and also a regular stop for me. For the most part, the menu changes every season so sometimes you end up missing out on some of those favorite dishes but I've never been disappointed when coming here. I've had every single item on their dining menu and all of the dishes were excellent! The pricing is pretty much in line with other restaurants but the portion and quality of the food is way up there. Once, we stopped by on Christmas for lunch and ordered from the holiday menu. The choices were very good but it would have been nicer if the regular menu was also available -- hopefully that's changed or they plan on changing it soon. Other than that, it never disappoints and Landmarc Tribeca will still be my #1 spot."
0,"Although we had to wait longer than expected for the food to arrive (and I think our party was the only one kept waiting), the food was outstanding and the service personnel were charming. One warning--if there is a disabled person in your party, be aware that there are tables on 3 floors, so a lot of stairs could be involved."
1,"Ok, I admit it.  I've never been a huge fan of Greek food.  I'm reminded of this place in Minneapolis, It's Greek to Me -- and eating this really, really REALLY tough octopus appetizer there.  I don't remember any other dishes there, though I ate their several times in high school in an attempt to be cool by going ""downtown"" or Uptown (yes, as in the Prince song too). Snack changed my mind. Creamy cucumber tsatsiki. Savory veal meatballs, bespeckled in pinenuts. Flaky spinach pies (how do you spell that?!). Oooooooh yeeeeeaaaah. We really liked the prices, portions and ambiance too."
0,Good chicken and waffles
0,Amazing Mexican restaurant. The taco appetizer platter (says for 2 people) but fed 3 of us as our entire meal. So delicious! Service was great as well!
0,"Small portions, overpriced and rude staff"
0,"Had a kiwi staying with me in Brooklyn, and we decided to check the place out. The food was great - best BBQ pork sandwich I've ever had, and a really unique and tasty soup. When they heard my friend's accent, the chef came out and we chatted a bit. Great guy, and I can't wait to go back again."
1,"My fiance said that I eat like a linebacker.  I think he's exaggerating just a tad, but I do love my food in large quantity.  The idea of tapas does not appeal to me at all.  Food in small quantities?  Pffffttt...  However, when one of my friends took me here one Saturday afternoon, I was absolutely smitten.  This is the perfect place to stop by after a long day of shopping in Soho (don't forget to drop by Harney & Sons for some tea!).  The space is simple but beautiful and well kept.  It's casual but also feels like a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.   They have wine, beer, little sandwiches, pintxos and small quiche-like dishes that are absolutely delicious.  Yes, a little expensive since you won't get full.   They have sausage and serrano ham samples at the deli counter up front, and bread and olive oil samples.  Stop by for an afternoon treat, try a few Spanish beers, and pick up some delicious serrano ham for later.  I recommend it for a casual lunch or afternoon snack."
1,"Obsessed. I came for brunch on a Saturday around 12:30. It was for a party of 7 (albeit the space is quite small) yet the wait wasn't too long. It ended up being a party of 5 and the table was ready for us before everyone arrived. The guy taking our name (who seemed like the owner) was so kind and understanding of our late party. Our server was also very kind. What I'm particularly obsessed about is how insanely affordable the menu was-- not only for New York City-- but for dining out in the kind of atmosphere Cornerstone provided in general. On top of that, the dishes I've tried were delicious. Although I only tried the Texas French Toast (I think $10) and the feta and spinach omelette ($9), it was good enough for me to want to come back and try something else. The french toast wasn't too egg-y, and that's what made it amazing! One of the best we've had. Perfectly sweet, with a lovely accompaniment of fruit for some tartness. The omelet came with potatoes, toast, and a salad. Salad was just okay, but I'm glad it was part of the meal. The butter..I don't know why (it might be because butter isn't really in my diet), but it was delicious on the toast. The omelette in general was just an omelette to be honest. But still, for the price (relatively), I can't complain. For five people, our total bill was less than $65! Next time, I wish to try the baked eggs, pancakes, or sandwich. But I do recommend the french toast. Extensive drink list (alcoholic, non, and coffees). Loved that they had a very good mix of sweet vs. savory on their brunch menu. It is cash only, so be prepared. Also, though I loved the quaintness, the music was a tad bit loud for our taste. To sum up, it's more than perfect if you want brunch in the city, and don't want to wait OR pay a ton. Fuss free, for, again, relatively good food. I'd make it my go-to if I'm having trouble deciding on brunch spots or if there were last minute planning to do."
0,Not bad. I say there is better though. Try Spice
0,"Went back again, it's always reliable for great dishes, attentive service, and a nice cozy atmosphere. One of my neighborhood go-to places!"
1,"Went there the day before Thanksgiving. The soup dumplings are interesting and good AND everything else was terrible including the service. When I returned the pork dish because it literally was slices of fat covered with sugary sauce the waiters were rude and almost insulting. When I refused to pay for the dish, they became very aggressive. The soup dumplings aren't that good!  I will never visit this restaurant again - EVER!"
1,"Meh, indeed. I had the clam pie. I think. I ordered it anyway. Got a cheese and garlic pie, with - possibly - tiny bits of clams on there.  Looked like the kind that came out of a can, pre-chopped for your chowder-making convenience. There was so much garlic, in raw, large chunks, that it was all I could taste. It was all I could taste later that night - through the whiskey. I could still taste it when I got up the next morning. It didn't taste any better then. And I love garlic. The crust was thick and doughy. Soft. Like the place itself. I can't say I'm a huge fan of Franny's, but Franny's has the same prices, and kicks this place's ass up and down the street, leaving it whimpering like the little doughy pies that it serves."
0,"long overdue review... delicious food, i really like the trip charcutero (three types of sausages/meats on the plate), brussel sprouts were pretty good, potatas bravas on target.  we were a pretty big group, and shared everything... i'd recommend this place"
1,"Had the calamari, it was good. And the manicotti which was horrible. 2hr wait for a table, but got 2seats at the bar upstairs which wasn't bad."
0,one word: amazing.
1,"Simply a great meal.  While it's been a while since I ate here, I do remember having a ropa vieja that changed my life and a goat cheese based flan that still makes my mouth water. The folks working there are also great - coolly moving about the place and injecting some cuban culture in to the experience. Salud."
1,"Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 8 people, arrived around 8:30 and wasn't seated until 10:30. Smaller groups would have been seated a lot sooner than a group of 8, I had better luck pulling a rabbit out of my a$$ than to be seated. It's a popular restaurant and the wait is to be expected. Finally got a chance to dine after the long wait, Had the meatball appetizer and Merguez  for entree, a second choice since they seem to have run out of the skirt steak. The meatballs were juicy and delicious and melt tender in your mouth. The merguez is basically a small gauge sausage link similar to breakfast sausage. The sausage alone seemed dry in the mixture. Preferably,  a sausage mix should have at least 25-30% fat, yes I make my own sausages if you must ask. Eaten together with it's accoutrement , tzatziki sauce and pickled vegetables, the flavors merry together in a blissful bites. In the end, despite having a long wait to be seated, the food did deliver and inevitably, that's what counts the most."
0,"Ive been to blend a couple of times, including for my moms birthday. The food is amazing. I've tried maybe 5-6 things on the menu and I've loved all of it ! Also the service is amazing. My server tonight was Stephanie and she gave us great service. Everything we asked for came quick, and she was super friendly! This is seriously one of my favorite places don't hesitate to try it!"
1,"Hands down...Best dumplings in Queens. Noodles hmmmmmm,."
0,What amazing food. Everything was so spot on. The arepas and meats were done to perfection. The flan is something that you have to finish off an a amazing meal with. Yes it is a small place and do have to wait for a seat. But once inside the service is prompt and the dishes will make you forget of the wait.
0,"I'm just gonna say, that sangria got me drunk enough to download this app and warn yall about the side effects of drinking a few pitchers of the red sangria ... And those side effects may possibly include: baby making practice, missing work the next day, forgetting how strong it is and going back for more! Ps. The food was rich and delicious! the staff, Natalee who sat us quickly with no reservation was awesome, Felicia who got us drunk and was too sweet! (almost gave us diabetes) lol, I must say this is now my new favorite spot... Kudos to whomever is responsible for this establishment!!!"
0,"Love the food here! Go with a group as everything is large portions! The chicken parm is the best, the cheese is so tasteful and the sauce is out of this world!"
1,Manager was rude. Williamsburg has a reputation for people who think a little too much of themselves -- look no further than Fette Sau.
0,"It is good, over priced but really quality stuff. You should go to check it out, but wouldn't recommend shopping there."
0,"Turns out, I've been to the neighborhood before, but I missed Graffiti because of the tiny little door. But, after watching The Next Iron Chef and becoming a huge fan of Chef Mehta, I of course looked him up and just /had/ to go to his restaurant. First impression: it's a lot smaller than you think it is from the pictures online--a crowded corridor at best, which is made even more crowded by the knicknacks and the measly four tables that occupy the area. Add in customers and the waiters, it becomes very difficult to move around, and you have to squish yourself into a very small space in order to get to your table. We were put on a communal table, which was a tight fit as well. That being said, I absolutely loved this place. Even though it's tiny, or maybe because it's so tiny, it completely embodies the whole eclectic, East Village atmosphere. It's dimly lit, with adorable mini chandeliers hanging haphazardly from the ceiling and a very efficient (yet quaint) setting of newspapers as placemats. Service: Was great, the servers were very considerate and our glasses were never more than half empty of water. Also, we got a very in-depth description of our food, along with what ingredients were supposed to do what in your mouth--very iron chef! Food: The Graffiti burger was served with garlic fingerling potatoes and chipotle mayo, and was definitely the highlight of the meal. They were small, two slider burgers with a piece of lettuce and some red onions on top and lightly toasted bread. It was an explosion of flavor, especially with the chipotle mayo spread on top. I can't name the exact herbs that were in the burger, but it's safe to say that they definitely worked well together, and with the meat. We also tried the Shredded Pork Buns with Apricot Chutney, which were just as delightful--the pork was flavorful, and there were cornflakes on top, which gave it an added crunch and just an interesting assortment of textures in your mouth. The apricot chutney was freshly made, and apparently had pits in it, but that didn't take away from the meal at all. For dessert, we tried the cupcake, and the strawberries with the pepper ice cream. The cupcake is arguably the best one I've ever had--makes sense, Chef Mehta's a pastry chef! The pepper ice cream was also interesting when aired with the warm strawberries, but the cupcake was definitely the standout of the two. I'm disappointed we didn't get to try the zuccini hummus pasta or the green mango paneer, but I have very concrete plans to go back and try the entire menu!"
1,"Literally the best restaurant that I have ever been to in my life. No Joke. I've been here three times so far, and every time it's ridiculously amazing. First time just me and my mom after an interview for college. Second, for my birthday. Third, for the day before mother's day. For apps, we always order the escargot and mussels with white wine. I hate mussels. Except in this place where they are orgasmic. DIP THE BREAD IN THE ESCARGOT AND MUSSELS SAUCES! Entrees: I've personally had the Filet Mignon, Hanger Steak, and the just recently added Seared Rib Eye with Peppercorn sauce. (Apparently I was, if not the first, one of the first people to actually have it :D) They were the best steaks I've ever had, and the vegetables are just ridiculously good. My mom has had the duck three times, so, well, yeah. She loves it. As for the rest of my family, they have had the lamb, and the Cod fish filet with saffron, also amazing. Okay, while all the apps and entrees are awesome, the desserts do not disappoint either. Profiteroles: Stop. Go now and order them. NOW. Chocolate Lava with Coconut Sorbet+Raspberry Sauce - *Tear gently rolls down cheek in remembrance of that amazing dessert* Still waiting to try the Choux Chantilly and Meringue dessert, but for now, it's too hard to stray away. Well while the food is great, something has to be said about the impeccable service as well. The first time we came, we were early by 20 minutes. The Host let us in and we were served early, and it was fantastic! The second time, on my birthday, we were surprised that we had a Polish waitress who was also fabulous and so helpful! This last time, the host and waitress, a super nice french woman too care of us and was simply perfect. She made dinner conversation and answered any question we had. She told us about any dishes we wanted to know about in detail. She really made the night great! OVERALL: Come here, you will not regret it. There might not be mammoth sized portions, but they make up for it in the flavor and presentation department. And honestly, the portions are fine, especially with unlimited veggies and dessert and apps :D Can't wait to come back whenever I can choose which restaurant to go to!"
1,Love this place! Service is awesome and their specials can knock you socks off.  I've only been here for dinner but have yet to try brunch.
1,"The pizza here is crazy good; not even sure if it has toppled my current favourite at Di Fara's, but this creation borne from a roaring 900F+ oven has certainly has bested the pies I've had at Fornino's, Grimaldi's, or even favourites from New England like Frank Pepe's in New Haven and Al Forno in Providence. We had the Crispy Glover and the (off-menu) Bee Sting.  Although the touch of honey on the latter was a delicious mix of sweet and salty, we still thought that the Crispy Glover was a more flavourful and mouth-watering experience.  We loved the savouriness of the guanciale and red onion, highlighted with just enough heat from the chilli to round things out. The surprise of the night came from the deceptively simple but overwhelmingly delicious grilled eggplant.  Beautifully matched with summer squash and an assortment of fragrant herbs, the grilled vegetables were served amidst an intoxicating tomato clam broth.  First thought?  I hope this recipe is in their cook book!  SO GOOD."
0,"The service is amazing and the food is even better.  This place is terrific, the owners are also truly amazing.. I have been to Hourglass Tavern several times for dinner and I love it more every time.  We also had a private party there and they did such an amazing job with the set up, food and service.. I suggest everyone go there and try this amazing restaurant."
1,"Pros: The food here is really good. We ordered the Fettuccini Provencale & the Parisienne crepe for our entrees. Oh & they're absolutely delicious! As for our dessert, we got the sweet crepes (Suzette & Belle Helene) & oh my God, they're so fantastic! The service was great. Friendly waiter. The place was pretty cozy. We like the decor. Very homey feeling. Great outdoor seating! Two entrees & two desserts, we spent about $40. Cons: Now this is a tough one. We really can't think of anything bad about this place other than maybe a bigger portion? Just stop by at this place. You won't be disappointed. Definitely will put a smile on your face...   =D"
0,"I rarely give a 5* review but this new restaurant really blew me away. Had a fantastic meal there last week whilst in NYC for 36hr stopover on a Fri night when the place was buzzing. The menu is fantastic value for NY and the quality is high, great variety of food from seafood to steaks, the seafood tower offered a great starter & twists on the classic chilled seafood starters - best oysters I've tasted! We had a rib-eye main to share (the most expensive thing on the menu at $90 - but we were celebrating!) but it was worth every cent. Delicious bone-marrow Bearnaise to accompany it as well. The cocktails were unusual twists on classic styles that worked flawlessly on your palate - I loved the Almond Gin Fizz (like a lemon sherbet!) and my boyfriend raved about the refreshing celery one (!!) that lifted him right out of his flu-symptons! I think another reviewer mentioned that the celery gimlet was a top hit too! We met some friends after our meal for drinks in the upstairs bar and they also commented on the excellent and attentive service, not too over-bearing but perfectly balanced and always there with what you needed - toothpicks threw them but them appeared with some small skewers that worked even better than the real thing! Decor is atmospheric and cosy, it's a little warm downstairs (in a warm Sept) so you might want to opt for upstairs seating (although it's noisier as it's near the bar) A top top choice for NYC and definitely on my list of venues for my next visit!"
1,"Last time I came here, the bad service and the drinks put me off. But this time we actually got a server that was really friendly and attentive. Our waters were always full and our grill got changed at least 3 times. Not sure if the survey after the meal that asked us to rate our experience prompted better service. We also didn't dare order the coco-mo again. This time we opted for the 2 person sakura party lunch special ($30) that came with four meats (kalbi chuck tare, kobe short plate, toro beef tare, and bistro hanger steak miso), rice, salad, miso soup, and addicting cabbage. The addicting cabbage was so not addicting....barely any flavor. Since it was a Saturday, we also got complimentary mimosa with our lunch special. Along with volcano crunch and yakitori, our bill was only $45. Great deal! We were both stuffed and satisfied."
0,OMG... What can I say about this place that's not already been said? This place is an italian heaven. The amazing food that you enjoy at the different restaurants! Amazin!!!!!!
1,french fries and mango chutney mayo.  nuff said.
0,"I live a block away and have been here dozens of times. The sandwiches are consistently very tasty - no complaint regarding the food. However, each experience is marred by the scowl and nasty attitude of the woman (asian) who is at the front taking orders. She seems to be there about half the time - all of the other cashiers are friendly, warm, and professional. If you are the owner, please be aware!! Treating your customers with basic respect which includes a smile & saying 'thank you', rather than a scowl and NO verbal response, should be MANDATORY at any restaurant which cares about it's reputation."
1,"Got here right at 12PM when they opened for brunch on Sunday. Thank goodness because by 12:30pm there was a wait Great food for $15.95 AND you get a coffee, OJ, sangria or Mimosa with your meal. Service was fast, prompt, friendly and food was out in a jiffy. Omelette's were simple and scrumptious. Croquette with ham and cheese on brioche was very soft and flavorful. My smoked salmon eggs Benedict was delicious. The best is that they serve you a side salad AND fries because let's face it, everyone wants a little of both! Overall, very positive and successful experience and I'll def. be back."
0,"Awesome place to get huge authentic Italian sandwiches. I have been here numerous times now and have never been disappointed. I also have never finished one of there sandwiches in one sitting either. All the meats and cheeses are imported from Italy and the bread is baked fresh every day in Brooklyn. The most recent sandwich I had was the Pisillo panini. Prosciutto, porchetta, bufala mozzarella, arugula, roasted peppers and balsamic. Absolute perfection! I can't recommend this place highly enough."
0,The owner and staff are very generous and friendly. The pizza is good and the calzone is the BEST calzone I ever had. They are fried and the cheese they use is delicious. Mmmm I go back for it all the time!
0,it's great!
1,"I am pleased to say I was not disappointed. The decor is clean and modern, while still keeping a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. That topped with the friendly service is a recipe for success! Popeye Delight Sandwich - wonderfully delicious. I have tried many of their dishes and have loved everything. I will continue eating here. Really good service too. PS the service is impeccable, genuine service attitude and attentiveness."
1,"It's nice to know that no matter when or what time I come back to GoGo, they will deliver the same quality meal over and over again. I love this place."
1,"I had dinner with my family at Marietta this past Saturday. It was a last minute second choice since the first restaurant we planned on going to was unable to accommodate our group of 8.  This was the happiest I've ever been after a rejection. The food was amazing, the salmon dish was one of the best I've had. I sampled some of my nephew's fried chicken which was crispy and delicious. Everyone enjoyed their dish from the steak to the mussels. The atmosphere was great. The old school reggae playing in the background was a nice touch along with the candlelit tables. Makes you feel like you're in a different place and not this quiet unassuming block in Brooklyn."
1,Flavor has always been awesome. The only drawback is the they only seat your group when everybody is here.
0,"LOVE this place.... Caught up with an old friend who shares a similar appreciation of phenomenal food & of course great company- we shared seven plates, from foie gras, to gnocchi to the brussel sprouts,  everything was delish....couldn't believe I hadn't heard of this W. Village gem earlier.  Can't wait to come back with a group of friends and order ""The Whole Shebang"" in which they bring your table everything on the menu, which takes the tasting menu concept to an entirely new level, yum......"
1,I came here with friends and it did not disappoint.  I had the pineapple fried rice.  I love the chandelier creation in the center of the place even though it soaks up some serious real estate.
0,"I haven't actually been to the restaurant, however, I've had food delivered. The hanger steak sandwich and roased chicken sandwich are my favorite and are absolutely delicious."
1,"At first glance, this place seems to have it all.  The restaurant is situated down an alleyway on the LES.  Upon approach, you feel like you've just been lifted into someone's quaint house in the burbs.  Once inside, the tables and bars were crowded (a good sign I was thinking).  We had a large group for a b-day party and the service was friendly and patient.  So far, so good.  Drinks were ordered and were pleasant enough.  But that's where it all ended. The Food: Apps:  Devils on horseback / olive oil poached tuna; Both were good, but nothing unique or special.  The tuna dish was a bit bland for my taste and the devils on horseback were waaaay too small.  The dates were small and the bacon was a small thin piece of a poor excuse of a bacon slice.   Sides:  mac n cheese, creamed kale.  The creamed kale was good.  Nice twist on the classic creamed spinach.  The kale held up nicely and maintained a good crunch.  The mac n cheese though was disappointing.  Why can't establishments just use more melty, oozing cheese?  I don't get it.  Bland at best.    More like mac n bechamel sauce.   Entrees: Eden brook trout (did not get to taste), pork loin, roasted chicken.  The pork was very tender and juicy.  It had a nice herbacious taste.  Pretty solid, but I've definitely had better pork loin.  The chicken was pale.  The skin wasn't crisp enough for my liking and lacked the herb flavor that the pork had.  The drizzle of pesto sauce that they put on top did nothing for the chicken either.  It felt lazy.   Desserts: sticky toffee, brownie, bananas foster.  The desserts as a whole were decent.  The sticky toffee (cake?) was good enough, but nothing to write home about.  The bananas foster was good, but the ice cream was fully melted by the time it got to the table and was a mess to serve.  The brownie was the only dessert that made me feel good about coming here.  Simple and tasty.   I'd easily give this place more stars if the food actually was in line with the price.  But nay, it was too expensive for what you get.  Food, 2 bottles of wine (nothing too pricey), a few cocktails set 11 of us back close to $1200 with tip.  That's a nice steak dinner at Del Frisco's or Primehouse.  Guess where I'll be taking my cash next time."
1,Very small place - only has 1 unisex bathroom. They opened in April of '01 and they're still rockin. 2 hour wait though. We put our name in and walked around afterwards. They even texted us 15 minutes before. Food was phenomenal. Got the Spanish scramble and blueberry pancakes. The blueberry pancakes came with a homemade butter sauce they make at a farm outside the city. Raspberry jam was killer - had to buy a few to-go to have for later. Cash only so don't forget to go to the ATM!
1,"I'm a recovering Austin-ite...the worst thing I can do on a cold, cloudy day is look at Texas real estate listings after a depressing search on street easy for a dog-friendly apartment with a washer dryer for less than a gazillion dollars...or day dream about Torchy's queso or Trudy's Mexican martinis in a city full of Chipotles and below average tacos made with mission flour tortillas. Which is to say there's really been very little Mexican food that I've found so far in the city that really reminds me of the style and quality I had at home in Austin, and if I ever move back to Texas, it will be because I want to stuff my face every day with damn good Mexican food and do my own laundry. Anyway, I went on a date here and had medium expectations. Maybe, just maybe, this would be a Mexican place worth more than one visit? Well, my dear Yelpers, I would say that yes, I would go here again! I would even go so far as to say that I think this is the best guacamole I have had in the city so far. I think what really sets it apart is the simple fact that they ask you how spicy you want it: mild, medium or hot. We had the hot. Finally, a guacamole in the city that isn't bland! Order it! The margaritas were just ok (the quest for a great margarita in NY continues), and the chicken flautas (appetizer) were also just average. I wouldn't get either again. BUT! The enchiladas suizas were so good. Definitely worthy of an Austin Tex-Mex establishment (very Trudy's suiza-esque). The sauce was perfectly creamy and cheesy, the chicken filling was also good. I loved every bite. I feel like every review needs some sort of conclusion (I guess this is a result of a particularly by-the-book high school English teacher), so in conclusion...all you need to know is this discerning Tex-Mex-aholic would eat here again. Get the guacamole, consider a drink other than a margarita, and order the enchiladas suizas, and I think you'll have a lovely experience."
0,now being cuban i can tell you for a fact that this place is authentic  100% cuban  this food is dammm good  i ordered the vaca frita  and holy shit it was good  a must try
1,"This was a 4AM munchies run after a night of partying it up. Friends craved it, so we went. There was a line out the door, so it must be good, right? We were lucky and were able to grab a whole spinach+artichoke pie as it was coming out of the oven. Sure, the guy at the counter charged by the slice versus the whole pie price (a $6 difference total), but at that hour, it's worth it for the convenience of the group. You get about 8 slices for a whole pie divvied up into two boxes because the thing is MASSIVE. The slices are bigger than your head. Unless you have a big head, then I don't know. Anyway, the dough was just right and thick - good for carb loading. The sauce was lusciously creamy. The cheese was good and melted, not chewy! And of course the flavors of the artichoke and spinach worked so well to tie it all together. Definitely have to go back here for more next time."
0,This is by far one of my favorite places in NYC. I've been a few times with a friend and we usually go on a weekend when it's packed. I recently took some out of town friends visiting from Florida and they raved about it as well. I haven't had anything so far that was bad. Tip- the Yuca Sunrise cocktail is super yummy. Frozen margarita and sangria. Nice combination.
1,"I love the food at this chain, but tonight when four of us walked in, even though there were two tables of six available, they refused to sit us. Sunday night. 12 seats open, wouldn't let us sit.  That simple."
1,"A very dim lit dining area provides a good date atmosphere for dinner.  It does have a very casual but intimate feel.  The staff was also very friendly and helpful with our orders and gave good recommendations if we were up in the air.   Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and experience overall. I heard the brunch is their forte, so I will be back for this.  Plus, they also have a billiards table in the back that I need to go to TOWN on! Buon appetito"
0,"I went here once, ordered pie , waited about 30 min. paid about $30 The pie was burnt on one side, but overall delicious. Was it worth $30 - not so sure!   =)"
0,"Super charming atmosphere, great place for brunch - heads up, the wait is a little on the long side and the service is mediocre but the food is fantastic. I recommend the vegi burger."
1,"I really enjoyed everything the food, atmosphere, and service. I've tried contadino, frittata bianca and patate(brunch menu). Good portion and very flavorful but NOT salty. Pastries are also excellent. I strongly recommend the toffee glazed brioche bun."
1,"Classic, brilliant, worthy."
1,"Horrible customer service Was told the wait would be 30 mins but ended up being over an hour. Asked the waiter for more water and he never came back. He never checked on us during the meal. Pizza is just pizza,  not worth the wait and service!"
1,"This spot is a gem. I kind of hate to review it with the five stars it deserves because I think it will mean longer waits, but I have to give props to Paige who makes this place run like clockwork. Fresh seafood for days. Great prices! Love love love it!"
1,Great Lobster roll. Comes with French fries and a small salad. 13 bucks. It was worth it.
0,"I was really excited to go to Luzzo's for dinner with my boyfriend, I read the reviews and everything. It was packed when we got there, good sign, right?? Wrong!!! I guess no one understands what makes a good pizza or Italian place.. for many reasons... Firstly, We had to wait a few minutes to be seated, so we sat at the bar and ordered some wine. Waiting a few minutes wasn't the problem. The problem was that out of all the wine they had on their ""wine list"", only 10% of them did they actually have on hand. The wine wasn't anything special, and we were a little disappointed for an Italian place.. they are the ones that know wine after all. We were then seated in the back, looked nice and romantic, but was so loud we couldn't even hear ourselves think, let alone, hear one another. So we moved back to the bar and ate there. The salad we ordered was decent, but who can really mess up a green salad... The pizza we got was disgusting!!!! It said on the menu that it came with roasted garlic, basil and we added olives. If we didn't add the olives the pizza would have been uneatable. There was only 3 pieces of basil and 4 pieces of garlic on the whole 18"" pizza. And to top it all off it tasted like they had cooked it with chlorine. I'm not the type to complain, but the whole experience was unpleasant. The only part I liked about it was the salad, which I could have easily put together at home. The $2.50 a slice pizza around the corner is 110% better than this expensive stuff. Don't go!! Save your money and your stomach!!"
1,"I went for their prix fixe dinner.  I must say that overall, the meal was sublime. I started with their green salad and while very simple, it was very nice.  I then had the tortelli ravioli.  The pasta was beautiful...so fresh...just divine! The halibut dish was sheer perfection...the fish was perfect and the accompaniments nicely chosen. The tartaletta dessert was indeed very interesting....an unusual mix of flavors so as I scooped up a bit of the chocolate tart as well as some of the various items placed alongside it, first I'd get a mocha flavor, and then a bit of grapefruit.  This dessert certainly was no boring chocolate dish! The service was very attentive. The only downsides were that 1) the restaurant seemed almost full to capacity and as such, the noise level was quite loud.  We had to yell to talk to the person seated next to us (there were six of us at the table).  2) I found the overall design and ambiance of the restaurant a bit too formal for my taste.  I love good food, but prefer it in more of a down-to-earth or intimate atmosphere, which this place was not. This place is good if you want to impress someone or make them think you have alot of money, or else it's good for expense-account type people.  For me however, ti's really not my kind of place, though the food was so damn good!! Was it worth the $84 prix fixe price?  I think so, considering that everything I had was quite perfect and the service was very good."
1,"*make reservations, BYOB, cash only! *also, i don't know why ppl keep saying in other reviews that this place doesn't have a bathroom.  IT DOES.  just ask, and they will lead you to it.  its in the back past the kitchen.   ordered:   pommes frites kobe burger truffle mac and cheese chilean sea bass & gnocchi w/olives (special of the day) lamb shank (special of the day) i reaaaaaaally enjoyed this place!  staff was super friendly, music was cute (all french), & i absolutely loved the truffle mac & cheese app...  really really delicious.  but, my fav was the chilean sea bass.  literally, just placed my fork on it... the whole thing was just so soft...  fell apart and... gah!  delicioussssss.  didnt even need a knife.  same goes for the lamb shank~  really really soft and just amazing overall.   i have a hard time coming back to places that i've been to once (hence the massive ordering)...  just b/c i'm so eager to try all the restaurants out there!  but, i may have to make a few more trips to sample everything.  it really was that good!"
1,"Well, I guess we lucked out, we went for a late lunch, walked right in and got a table- no wait at all.  The pizza was great, but I don't see what all the hype is about.  The service and atmosphere were nothing special- it's just a pizza shop!  Somehow we wound up spending around $75 buck-a-roos on a pizza, some wine, and dessert.  I'm glad we had the opportunity to experience the well-known Grimaldi's, but if I were hungry and there was a line I wouldn't be heart broken about choosing a new place."
0,"Food was bad, service was horrible, and  I will never waste my time or my money at this bush league establishment again!"
1,"Only one word to describe this place: Quaint. :D Love this place. Great food, great service. Its a small place, but you don't feel cramped in. - Good to take a date? Yes. Definitely. Specially when its warm, go outside.. - Good to take the family? Maybe - Good to take your wife/girlfriend? Yes, lots of Browne points. --------------------------------------------- THE REVIEW --------------------------------------------- THE PROTAGONISTS: Friend and I THE PLOT: Thursday night. Raining. Coming from LI, at 7pm. Hitting traffic all the way. THE OUTCOME: The traffic and rain was worth it. Loved this place. Highly recommend the celery cream soup and the fish. It name started with a T. Totally forgot, but its was awesome. Also try the yellojacket: pineapple juice, orange juice and lemon juice. IMPORTANT NOTE: Since its off-street parking, if you don't find a spot within your first loop around, go park two blocks up at the public parking on queens blvd. Lots of parking there. But bring quarters, its 25 cents per 20 mins. So 5-6 quarters should be plenty."
1,"A birthday celebration for eight, still felt intimate in this casually elegant space. Cocktail choices and aperitif menu were excellent, I opted for a Carpana Antica, but there is something to satisfy any palate. Similarly, the wine list is well thought out. Our server was attentive, knowledgable and helped us experience a variety of dishes.  The crudo and meatball appetizers stood out, as well as the chicken three ways and pork rillette.  The dishes are subtly seasoned bringing out the quality of the ingredients. Considering the size of our party, in a venue that maybe seats 30 at the tables, we were not rushed and it was prime dinner hour on a Saturday.  I highly recommend for a foodie date!"
1,"A buddy of mine hyped this up all day and we finally checked it out. It definitely met expectations and was pretty yummy. For me, it was good drunk food. As a warning, the hot sauce is extremely spicy. Was coughing like crazy while trying some."
0,"I was introduced to this place when a friend had us meeting here for breakfast before we took in a matinee movie nearby. She lives in the neighborhood, so I guessed it was going to be good. I don't get into the city as much as I'd like, but places like this are a big part of why I love NYC. It's small and comfortable, and it serves great food because it has to in order to survive. The wait staff seemed oddly large to me in relation to the size of the restaurant. I wasn't sure who our waiter was or even if we had a designated waiter. After ordering our beverages, another waiter stopped by to take our beverage orders. I don't consider that a negative. I had a very nice iced latte and the Crepe d'Isis, which contained bacon, egg, cheddar and tomato. It was fantastic, as was the small side salad that came with it. I made the stupid mistake of leaving my card behind when I paid the bill, but I have to say that when I called and confirmed they had it, I was glad that I had a reason to go back into the city the next morning to retrieve it and have a repeat of the same great breakfast while I was there. I consider it a shame that I may never have reason to eat there again. If you get the chance, don't skip it."
1,"Some of the food is ok, some is not. Enchiladas were pretty decent, but the rice was old. Flautas tasted frozen and reheated, so whether or not they were, they weren't good tasting. But here's the kicker... As we were about to pay our bill, the hostess came to our table and asked us to get up and move our table of three to a two seater so she could push our table into another and make room for a party of six. So instead of waiting three minutes and bringing us the check, she had us get up and move while we are wrapping up our meals. She cramps us into a small table to wait for our bill and doesn't so much as offer any compensation (a round of drinks, etc.) to soften the blow. Pretty amateurish and a new experience in any restaurant I've been in. It's not that she's a bad person, she is simply just horrible at her job and probably socially ill-equipped to work in service of any kind. The rest of the service experience was just fine, quick with no frills and no extra help (they forget your water, not a big deal, but they make you ask twice). The staff seem overworked and under-supported. I imagine the management could do a better job giving their people the resources (and maybe training) to create a better environment. On a side note to add insult to injury, I asked for hot sauce only to be given salsa and then charged for it without being told there was a cost. So, it's a nickel and dime you and shove you into a corner place. Being from Los Angeles, I appreciate the Lakers and Dodger love, but that's the only thing similar to LA Mexican food here. This place has nothing of the warm family local feel of LA Mexican restaurants and taco joints where service is fast and sweet. The food, sadly, is not only not like that you find in LA, it's just not special at all. When the service is bad and the food is just ok, the place is just not worth going to. New York is not known for Mexican food, and it's a shame this place didn't step up to the plate for it. I will give them this, however, they were packed. Someone's enjoying it."
0,Stopped by last night to grab a drink. And the customer service was deplorable!!!! a tall disheveled white guy with glasses was just plain rude and curt! great customer service is key to customer retention!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!
0,"My boyfriend and I made reservations at 8:30 pm on a Friday night. We arrived at 8 pm and were immediately seated! Yvette was our server. and I love her  She was AMAZING!! Fast, friendly, attentive and holy shit can that woman work a bunch of tables. She was great I got the Chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes. AMAZING again. Did not disappoint. My boyfriend got the chicken skirt steak with mac and cheese, BBQ fried rice and a biscuit. He enjoyed it thoroughly. I will be coming back. I hope Yvette is there to amaze me again."
0,Nice pizza. Really good taste. Awesome Service and nice place.
1,"A super duper expensive place with an average menu and average service plus dicky bartenders - chefs who are not ok with jokes. There, I said it."
0,"If you just want to eat a lot and not spend a lot of money, then this is probably a good place to go. There's a decent amount of options, but I am a big fan of noodle soup and for a place that has ""Great NY Noodle"" in it, I expected it to be a little bit better. The soft shell crabs are good, but the texture of the noodles was only mediocre. If money is a big factor when rating a restaurant, then I guess you could give this a 4-star. But quality is most important when going out to eat. There are also much better restaurants out there that have great noodles."
0,"service - helpful, attentive, rushed very noisy but it's a little place! - softshell crab over asparagus risotto - crunchy fried soft shell crab over creamy, not too heavy asparagus risotto and stewed grape tomatoes...amazing. - ricotta cavatelli and tomato broth - high end ABC soup to me, very good but not out of this world - gravy sliders - three luscious meatballs in little cheesy buns - buns not so good, meatball very good - beau soleil oysters - ooh heaven - scallops over a bed of spicy greens, parsnip puree, grapes, calamari  are the BEST scallops i have EVER EATEN EVER - they really know how to make their scallops with excellent char marks and absolutely tender on the inside - pork chop - the other amazing pork chop i had was at babbo and this is certainly a keeper - over spicy greens and parmesan butter beans oooh so gooooooood and tender juicy morsels, just want to suck the meat off that bone - strawberry rhubarb crisp and marscapone gelato - generous portion, tart, tangy, mushy, crust could have been baked longer and been more crunchy, marscapone gelato fantastic - chocolate cake was dense, rich, good portion and that espresso gelato is the absolute most flavorful i have ever had. tasted like i was biting on an espresso bean - raspberry beignets could have been less greasy, the filling was extremely tart, but it went well with the nutella. beignets should come with something cold - ice cream would have done the trick. i want to eat everything on that menu. EVERYTHING."
1,"My fave NYC pizza place. Perfectly crisp, thin crust pizza. Robust sauce. And tasty toppings. I love the atmosphere here too. It's laid back & fun. Decent bar. Even though the place is out of my way, I go the distance because I've yet to be disappointed with the quality of the pizza. The only area in which this place falls short is customer service as the staff is not very inviting, but I don't care. When I go here, I go for great pizza and beer with friends, not for small chit-chat with strangers."
1,"This place was not worth it for the money. I had the pizza and my friend had the lasagna (water to drink) and our bill was $40. Her portion of lasagna was on the smaller side and while my pizza was large, it was definitely watery. No bread to start with or anything, either. Not impressed, won't be back."
1,Great food at very decent prices. Always goes here when I'm in NYC. This is the Cafecito Mojito.
0,"TO die for! Pizza is phenomenal. REAALLY wish they would deliver. Downside to brunch- they ALWAYS run out of fresh squeezed OJ.  Some servers are nice and allow us to buy a bottle of *expensive champagne and bring in our own OJ. Also  wish they accepted CC. I'd spend more money that way. I so love this place.  Really, even with the little downsides, I'd still go every weekend if I could."
1,Came here with some friends for dinner. This is actually a really nice place for a date. tapas that you should order: -brussel sprouts  is the most delicious brussel sprouts I've ever had and i dont normally like brussel sprouts. -Fried Goat Cheese with lavender infused honey -Squid Ink Paella -Bacon Wrapped Dates & Olives
0,"This place. This friggin' place. I went to Pies n' Thighs for my first time about two years ago and got my first chicken biscuit. I've been hooked since. Last summer Pies n' Thighs catered my wedding (you didn't know they did catering? THEY DO AMAZING CATERING) and I was happy with their service and hospitality at every turn. Anne Marie (the catering manager that I worked with) was great from day one. They knew how to work at my pace and they asked all the right questions to make sure my wife and I had the best possible experience. If you're in Williamsburg and you want a great tasting meal that will leave you feeling great and won't break the bank, Pies n' Thighs is the spot. Get a chicken biscuit or a pulled pork sandwich with some mac n' cheese and some baked beans. Chase it all down with a slice of pecan pie or a donut, and back in the glory of the most perfect comfort food ever."
1,"I have been a regular at this latin restaurant for the last 3 years. The tapas are consistently good. The mojito is top notch. Its very busy on weekends, I prefer to go on weekdays. They have a tapas special on tuesday which is a great deal. Its a little on the expensive side but like I said the food is high quality!!"
1,"I only came here to pregame before hopping to another spot for a Yelp Event, but I have to say its a pretty solid place. It made me feel like I was in a 1950's diner, maybe because the paint scheme was similar to the feeling you get looking at Edward Hopper's Nighthawks. The vibe is just that cool. I went with simple and got a bowl of some tasty salted french fries and a beer with a shot of whiskey on the side for under $10. so this place was a win."
0,Big Wong is legendary. Best wonton noodle soup and congee in Manhattan. It's where I go whenever I want comfort food. Food is cheap and incredibly fast. Like order to table in less than 3 minutes. Food is consistently good. Roasted meats like the roast duck and roasted port over rice and soy sauce is another favorite of mine. Goal is to try out their entire menu (which is huge).
0,"I'm the 'double meat' guy and I've been going to this place for quite some time now. Why is that? Because not only is the service top notch- friendly employees, really fast service - but also because the food is so amazingly tasty and fresh. I usually get the Steak  Plato, but I've also tried the chicken and pork. They are ALL good. The cut of meat that this place uses is superior to all other places I've tried. They have a huge line going out the door, but that line usually moves pretty quickly. What impressed me most is the care and attention to detail, not to mention the painstaking work the employees put into making your burrito or taco or plato. This place has gotten very popular through word of mouth for it's fresh ingredients and great service and simply delicious food. Very very deserving of the 5 star rating."
1,"My brother brought me to Ippudo during my visit last month-- he had been raving about the ramen ever since I arrived. I had my doubts that they could serve up a better bowl of ramen than my favorite ramen joint (Santouka) in Los Angeles but I was open to giving it a try. So, they say you should never judge a book by its cover... Ippudo is hip, modern chic, clean and looked so shiny and new... which, well, to most people, is probably a sound choice when it comes to restaurants, but to me, it seemed like another Asian restaurant trying to appease the non-Asian crowd. I imagined folks who knew nothing about ramen raving about this place when they couldn't you tell the difference between Soba noodles and Ramen noodles. Basically... just another gimmicky P.F. Chang-type spot. But I digress... and I was terribly mistaken. Ippudo was pretty damn amazing-- the Berkshire Pork Belly Buns and the Akamaru Ramen were both excellent. Ippudo is probably one of the better ramen joints I've been to but I think paying $13 for a bowl of ramen and modern chic  decor is a bit steep-- considering I can get a $8 bowl at Santouka."
1,"This is a fabulous little corner French restaurant tucked away in a residential section of the West Village.  I have been at least four times throughout the years, and I am once again reminded why this place rates highly in my books. I went at yesterday at around 6pm on a beautiful Friday in May.  The outdoor seating was full, but there wasn't a line, yet.  I was seated promptly once my friend showed.  The service was good and the dining experience was rushed, despite the line that quickly formed after us and that persisted through our entire meal.  It is BYOB without a corkage fee.  I have had the bouchee a la reine (includes a salad), grilled salmon, and the sauteed chicken.  Everything I have ever had was delicious, and I highly recommend the bouchee.  Next time, I'll definitely order the mussels to try something different. One must save room for dessert, as they prepare their pastries on site.  I had the dacquoise (chocolate ganache, meringue and hazelnut, covered with toasted almonds), and it was an excellent finish to a delicious outdoor dining experience on a beautiful New York Friday evening. BTW, it is cash ONLY."
0,One of the best ramen restaurants in NYC but be prepared to wait in line for a while. I love the texture of the perfectly cooked noodles and the flavorful broth that forms the delicious bowl of ramen. The wait at Ippudo can sometimes be ridiculously long so I always try to arrive earlier.
0,"My first experience was with their chicken&lamb with rice last Friday when it was pouring. I worked late (Yea, sucks especially on a Friday). I had the cravings for a solid dinner. I read from Midtown Lunch that rain is usually the best time to go to The Stand. There was still a short line of people waiting, I bought it, walked through Times Sq. in the rain (without an umbrella like the silly monkey I always am), and took the train home. Even after it got cold, I enjoyed the meal very much. I like how I was in charge of the sauces myself and the container is aluminum (not unhealthier and cheap styrofoam like most places). I've tried a couple of other places around my office but they are not nearly as good as this cart. The one on 48th and 3rd is decent though in the flavor dept. but they're lacking in size...which will lead me into the discussion of the day. 53RD AND 6TH VS. SAMMY'S I have summer fridays now so I can bounce earlier but late enough to miss the full-on lunch hour rush. I decided to hit up the not-so-famous 53rd and 6th lunchtime cart. They are just as good in foodwise. You don't get your own sauces, portion seems a bit smaller but it is only $5, not $6 during evenings, and still aluminum container. I grabbed a seat somewhere close and devoured my chicken&lamb with rice. It was good street meats. I'm usually a chicken&rice kinda guy but I like to compare the flavors in the combo so getting The Mix has been more and more my usual now. I went back to my area to chill and relax a bit with buds. Afterwards, on my way home, I decided to visit Sammy's, the Chicken&Rice king in Jackson Heights, Queens. There was no long line but certainly a bunch of people wanting to order. I decided to get my current usual, walked about 10 mins. back home, and tried my best to enjoy dinner. The food was alright. Something was missing though and the guy probably thought I wouldn't notice. How about equal part Chicken? How do you mess up Chicken&Lamb with rice? Well, by giving me 90% lamb and barely any chicken. WAY TO GO! I don't know if this is because I'm not a usual customer but come on now! He heard me say Chicken AND Lamb. The guy, not Sammy, but his assistant, even told me to take a can of soda with me. I knew it was kinda suspicious but hey, free soda! I grabbed my ginger ale and walked home of course! Maybe he thought I wouldn't complain since I got a free soda but he could've told me to wait for the chicken. I'm patient enough to wait with the crowd. Maybe he just wanted me off on my way and sent me packing with carbonated delight. I'm not fond of their styrofoam but they will not get any stars taken away for it. Let's do a final breakdown: SAMMY'S Food is good, Sauces are ok, no presence on hot sauce, my combo priced at $6 but I didn't even get enough chicken and adding soda to the unhealthy mix is an unequal treat to me enjoying chicken.  I will give them props for their lamb, chopped into little chunks, and tasty. Portion is not hefty to justify $6 in Queens. Regular Basmati Rice is ok.   53rd and 6th (Day) Food is good, Sauces are ok, a better hot sauce, my combo is only $5 and this is in the City, not Queens, the slices of pita are a welcomed side, chicken is solid but lamb is average, not chunks, but slithers. Portion is decent for $5 in the City. Orange Basmati Rice is decent.   53rd and 6th (Evening) Same as day, except combo is $6 dinnertime price, you get your own sauces and still decent portion. Yes, much better than PUNY sammy's and their stingy $6 platter in Queens. The Winner: 53RD AND 6TH during Lunch. Somebody take away the Vendy that was ever awarded to Sammy's and make sure these guys get one! LOL."
0,"Awesome place! I went for a date here a few weeks back and it was one of the most romantic dates ever. We both were pretty full from lunch, so we just ordered pizza and wine. The pizza had the most delicately baked crust I have ever had and really well cooked toppings. The ambience is perfect for a romantic evening together, with minimal lighting and beautiful candles on every table and an old worldly charm around you. The price is a bit on the higher side, but compared to how costly the rest of New York City is and what a great experience it was, it was totally worth it."
1,"Yeah, it's the best ramen around.  And their pork buns are no joke either.  If you can stand the wait, hang in because dude it's good."
1,I dont understand why you losers go wait for 1-2 hours at Totto and Ippudo when Minca kicks ass. Also Terakawa! Go back to taking pictures of food!
1,"My family and I ate Brunch here on Sunday to celebrate my Dad's birthday and it was a wonderful afternoon.  There were 8 of us in total and the table we sat at was private and disconnected from the rest of the restaurant, making us feel like VIP guests :-) We had many questions about the food and the waitress was extremely well versed in the menu, providing us with detailed explanations about each dish.  She recommended the Dutch Baby for my entree and I am so glad that I listened to her - it was amazing!  It came out sizzling on a skillet with fresh lemon to squeeze on top of it.  The presentation of the crafted cocktails was fabulous!  So fabulous that my brother-in-law got his cell phone out to take a picture (that hasn't happened in the 10 years I've known him).  My sister and brother-in-law recently moved to Battery Park which is why we ate at this little gem of a restaurant.  We didn't know what to expect but it was one of the best family meals we have ever enjoyed.  From the impeccable and attentive service, to the fresh and delicious meals, North End Grill gets 5 stars in my book!"
1,The food was amazing and the service was great! My only negative comment is that the seating area was a little crumby.
0,"I came here with a friend and the quality of the food was embarrassingly poor. We waited a long time for it, only to have our appetizers arrive cold and my friend's pasta plate was clearly rushed - sloppy, badly oversalted, and very bland. She barely touched it. My pizza was overcooked and the quality of the ingredients was low. Come on guys, there are a million places in New York to get mediocre pizza, at least make an effort. On the positive side, the atmosphere was nice, our waiter did his best, and the dessert was good. But overall, this was a very poor experience and I won't be back. Also, $20 corking fee? Really? As another reviewer noted, it's not our fault you guys messed up on your wine license. Shamelessly gouging your customers to make up for your own mistakes is no way to make friends, Emporio! There are many better options for good Italian food in Nyc, at far more reasonable prices."
0,"I've been to this place twice to take non-Venezuelan people to try our food. The first time I did not find it great but my friend and I liked the ambiance and service. For the second visit my husband and I were in the area, so we went to have some drinks and tapas. Their sangria is horrible and unworthy. I never had such a bad sangria anywhere in my whole life, and I believe the person who made has never tried one in his/her life. We ordered a parrillada. Everything was fresh, but you do not expect sauteed beef to be served as parrilla, or to have the guasacaca thrown on top on the food with no care for the look of it. I never complain to a waiter/ess unless I need to change the food, so we just did our best to have a good time and decided not to come back. Finally, we were charged a 20% tip up front, even though we never expressed our discontent to anyone. I usually find this to be upsetting, especially when you have gone with American friends to the same place and were not charged the tips up front. People who have worked at restaurants will know what I mean. In sum, I wished they worried about the food served as much as they do about the decor, which is really nice. Anyway, I will never go to this place again, and will tell anyone who asks to stay away from it."
0,"This is another belated review...I ate here a few times, the last time being around 2006/2007. Read on to find out why. The food was consistently great. Groin-grabbingly good if you will. I have a fond memory of hopping in the photo booth downstairs with my little sister -- she still has that photo strip to this day. All around, good times. BUT, something awful happened. Something that should NEVER ever happen in a restaurant. I saw a MOUSE. IN THE RESTAURANT. It scurried under our table, I screamed and literally leap-frogged my way out of there never to return. If there is a mouse in the dining room good Gd what the hell is in the kitchen??? Almost more disturbing than the rodent sighting was the fact that no one else seemed unnerved by it. Perhaps they have resolved this problem, but I am not brave enough to find out. I would have given this place 4 stars for food, but I need to give it one star for ambiance/cleanliness. EDITED TO ADD: OMFG I scrolled down through the reviews and read something Julia H posted from 2007....please read the below link that shows Bubby's was closed for numerous health code violations and take note of #7 -- perhaps what I saw was not a mouse, but a RAT. I think I just threw up in my mouth. I *know* that it was years ago...but still...NOT okay. newyork.grubstreet.com/2…"
0,"cubaNO ANTI-social . . . williamsburg gets a bad rep for the hipsters and the pretentious/smug aura that fills the air. But after moving here a few months ago i like to try to stay optimistic and appreciate the fact that they try to bring some sort of culture and a more organic life style to the city. Cubano social takes the negativity and runs with it. My friend and i entered the restaurant and were not greeted. ordered and over priced cocktail that had no booze in it (COME ON!) Bought a vegetarian special that consisted of beans. rice. some avocado. and some sort of spinach crap. The wait staff would NOT make any eye contact with us and while the restaurant was completely empty . . . and trust me . . . we were the ONLY ones in there, we were totally ignored and treated like crap. yes, there was marks brothers movie playing on the wall... but i couldn't even enjoy it because of the nasty life hating vibe that stunk up the room."
1,"When we first walked in we were told it was a 10- 15 minute wait. After 25 minutes we were told again it would be 15 minutes. The chef (or possibly owner) saw us waiting and felt bad for our party of 4. See made us a spring roll to share while we waited and apologized profusely. We she brought the spring roll it was at a good time because I was nearing the point where I thought I would go somewhere else instead. (I don't mind waiting as long as I have a decent idea of how long the wait is going to be the first time around) Anyhow, we sit down and place our order immediately. We had plenty of time to look over the menu while we waited for a table. Our order arrived very fast. And our servers were courteous and friendly. I ordered calamari to start and the burger for my meal. The calamari was great. It came on skewers that had very large chunks so once you were done you didn't feel like you wanted more calamari. But then my burger arrived.... I can't begin to explain how awesome this burger tastes. This is a Thai restaurant serving one of the best burgers I've ever tasted, hands down. I don't care how many of my down south country friends rail on me for liking, much less ordering, a burger from a Thai restaurant. This burger has all the fundamentals necessary to be called a burger but it's so much more. Cooked to perfection and paired perfectly with all of the ingredients that come with it. There's is no reason to add or take away from this burger once it shows up in front of you. You can take a second to look at this burger because it comes out after that just dig in. This is the burger needed to convert vegetarians the world over. Damnations, this was a tasty burger. I'd like to think if Guy Ferrari tasted this burger he would find another line of work because he would know that no matter what he did it wouldn't hold a candle to this burger. To the owner I say a hardy Thank You. If I known who you were when I was there (man or woman) I would have given you a big hug and a kiss. Needless to say if I ever go back to NYC I'll be stopping in and having another burger or two."
0,"This spot won't stay secret for long! If you're a fan of places like Huckleberry Bar, or just enjoy a damn well mixed cocktail, go down to the counting room. They offer refreshing takes on classic drinks. For me, the real treat is discovering this place's bar food! And trust me, you'll need it because you won't want to stop the flow of delicious cocktails. I recommend the baked herbed crouton, pork sandwich or grilled cheese with truffle oil. If you're not such a drinker, step upstairs for a light brunch, benedict salad or french toast on a stick. Enjoy the large selection of wines, also reasonably priced."
1,"Long wait. Crowded restaurant. Delicious pizza. Someone told my husband, ""When you're in NYC, you HAVE to try Lombardi's!"" So, we did. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, which I found rare going to touristy restaurant in NYC. You start with a margherita pizza, and you can add toppings. We only added one topping, cause if I remember right, it's around $3 per topping. We added pancetta and it was DELICIOUS!   If you're looking for an overpriced,  non-greasy, but flavorful pizza, go to Lombardi's! Oh yeah, hubby left a bag of stuff we bought at a street vendor under the table, and we remembered when we were a couple blocks away, and we went back and they had it! They have some lost and found hooks, and the waiters and good at looking under the tables - must happen frequently with tourists such as us."
1,"This is why Yelp invented 5 stars.  Bouley earns all of them.  The dining experience here is absolutely what you would expect from a world class 5 star restaurant.  The apple scent upon entry is delicious.  The restaurant is beautiful with nice domed / arched ceiling.  Servers are well trained.  The bread guy is outstanding - we all have seen cheese carts before, but a bread cart?  It is for real.  Food is outstanding of course, and the little in between courses they feed you are a delight.  Special occasion?  This is one of your best options."
0,"I went for their Kentucky Derby party and my wife and I had a blast.  Granted, we only had appetizers and beverages.  It's a nice neighborhood pub, with some stepped up food.  Fried pickles were amazing.  Very friendly service.  Fun event."
0,"My gal pal Mel and I went here about a week ago and we had such a blast, even having to wait a bottle of wine's worth of time for a table. The ballz are solid. I only tried the porky ones, but I'm going back tonight to sample other flavors. The sides were delishious. And the wine list is decent and reasonable. The best part about this place is when the host comes over and asks how you are enjoying your ballz."
1,"Super cute place. The happy hour prices went up to $5 but they have a nice selection. When my friend and I went, the white wines weren't very cold making the wine hard to drink but I am confident that its not always like that. We got two apps that were super tasty (great sauces) but very small. The sandwiches looked good too!"
0,I've had many servers/bartenders but I must admit that no one has matched the professionalism and courtesy that Paige delivered today. Food - great. Drinks - awesome. Music/Ambiance - upbeat yet chill. Coming back isn't even an option! Thanks Paige for making an ordinary Monday memorable.
1,"The food here is FANTASTIC.  Home-cooked italian flavors and dishes.  And no matter what you order, you must try a ""square"".  By far, my favorite family style italian place. And the prices are awesome too!"
1,"Late on my review, ,, was here few months ago,,,was recommended, ,, Pros- food was tasty but small portion, , did not want to share with        my man cause it was small portion of everything. ,         -arrepa appetizer was awesome but over priced.         -Drinks was good,         -romantic spot due to the dim lights.        - tried to be attentative to us.        - fast seating if u reserve. Cons- upon entering, I felt as if I was in a club , hoochie mama everwhere.              HELLO , 7 OCLOCK,,ITS A RESTAURANT,  NOT A CLUB, ,,           -Music was loud, which would've been ok if it was clear,  instead it sounded like noise instead. Spent the night yelling across the table.           - Not as romantic,  especially when your practically hving dinner with strangers, , tables to close to one another.          - view outside was not all that, ,, tall fence n bushes covered the view."
0,good food and atmosphere. but too crowded and unfriendly service. at least i got the impression of an unprofessional staff. but food is still alright and good place for larger parties.
1,"Visiting from Melbourne, Australia. Tonight we tried Pepe Rosso Social after seeing great reviews. For a party of five we paid about the same as we would back home for pasta and wines for all. The quality however was not what we'd expect from such great reviews! The pasta didn't taste like it was even close to home made, some of it was sticking together . The sauces red and white were nice but nothing special. The atmosphere was nice but I felt like we were being rushed out at the end of the meal. My boyfriend waited ages after ordering a second drink and then had to ask again.  The service was ordinary.."
1,"This tourist trap has some ok pizza, but it's vastly overrated.  The crust is bland, the cheese is tasteless, the pepperoni is cut from the cheap pepperoni sticks, and the tomato sauce doesn't taste tomatoey--it tastes like a red, salty, pasty mess.   The combination is definitely edible, but only because each of the ingredients mysteriously masks the deficiencies of the others.  Salt and texture can go a long way to making something mediocre taste better than it is, in other words.  Add that to the line and cash-only and you're better off looking for an alternative.   Speaking of alternatives, let me recommend two:  1) Paulie Gee's (Greenpoint) and 2) Best Pizza (Williamsburg), both of which are relatively close to Grimaldi's, geographically.  The former serves Rome-inspired innovations which are absolutely delicious (may I recommend the Delboy, Monte Cristo, and Cherry Jones--though they're all amazing).  The latter is also definitely its own animal: Roman-like, but also serves thick-slice as well, both amazing.  But less known is that Best Pizza also serves probably the best meatball subs and chicken parms in the 5 boroughs (and I'm truly not kidding).   Both of these institutions deserve much more fame than they presently possess and are infinitely better choices than Grimaldi's."
1,"I rarely ever venture into Brooklyn, but I would return to Bogota for the maduros (fried sweet plantains) and sangritas (sangria and frozen margarita) alone. The decor is eclectic, colorful, and just one notch below overdone. At every turn, you will feel like a magpie drawn to the shiny lights and accessories. We were seated at a communal table, which was LOUD but fun. Don't come here if you feel like having a serious conversation - you'll be shouting ""WHAT?"" over the table, when you're not distracted by that interesting decoration behind your dining companion. I love that Bogota serves complimentary plaintain chips on the table, but I'm not quite sure why the sauces are so special. Bogota sells their sauces by the bottle, but I wasn't wowed by the flavors. The vegetables tacos weren't very flavorful, and I was pretty disappointed by them. But the sides I chose - maduros and vegetarian black beans - were probably the highlight of my meal. As a side note, I really appreciate the fact that Bogota labels its menu items as gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan. This is a crowd-pleasing place that offers something for everyone."
0,A lucky choice.
1,"Their lamb is quite tasty and they give A LOT. I don't like their chicken much, but you can't beat the price."
1,"Despite the packed seating, I still felt my meal was enjoyable.  Bianca rocked my socks off.  The price is decent and the food is emaculate.  I had the chicken w/balsamic vinegar and it was cooked to perfection.  The chicken was moist and tender.  The balsamic vinegar was reduce down a bit to a semi-thick consistency.  The veggie side on the side made me feel healthy.  The Gramigna Con Salcicca E Peperoni was not bad, but the Spaghettini In Pomodoro was basic, yet delicious. Oh yeah, I have a problem.  I can't walk out of an Italian eattery (or any place) that has panna cotta on the menu.  YUM!"
0,"I though LA used to have the best tacos but boy was I wrong. They have small plates that you can share and have large portions as well. Their appetizers and rinks are good and filling too if you just want to go for a cheaper alternative although their prices are beyond fair. Sometimes they do get ridiculously busy but that's because they're so good. Again, no matter how busy they are, service has always been impeccable."
1,"A really wonderful and quaint coffee shop with good iced coffee, fast wifi, and pleasant staff. Perfect and quiet for work/study."
0,"Ordered delivery from this place a few times and the food was decent.  They messed up the order on one occasion, but the owner was very cool when I called back, and the next time I ordered, they threw in a decent amount of free food to make up for it. Recommended."
1,"I love avocado at baseline, but fried avocado is pretty awesome too! :) Needless to say, the fried avocado and jalapeno taco is rockin' and so is the blackened catfish one. The Al Pastor was pretty decent too. I was totally craving Mexican today and this definitely hit the spot. Yay for more yummy places on Franklin Ave! The fried chicken taco, on the other hand, kinda sucked. It was dry, didn't lend any flavor to the taco, and was in the form of almost like a fillet? Also, despite the rave reviews, I was OK on the frozen margarita. It is strong though, so I guess it's a good value :) I originally didn't quite understand what Allison T. meant when she said that there wasn't much of a dining experience at Gueros, but she's totally right..it's more Chipotle style in terms of ""just order and nab a seat"" than I expected. I guess I'll hit up Chavela's for that instead!"
1,Blend on the water definitely deserves a 5 star every time I come here I am never disappointed !! As I come in to the hostess stand to the bar and dinning room the staff at blend are very welcoming and attentive . I've had the salmon that company's it with cilantro mash potatoes to die for and to the skirt steak (churrasco) to the Mac and cheese with chorizo I recommend them all . We can't get enough with blends reasonable prices happy hour from 11am to 7pm ! Must try the frozen sangrita Shout out to the bartenders for there amazing drinks !
0,"Spectacular I highly recommend this outdoor bar, very chill, delicious freshly brewed beers .. Ask for Melony she's awesome and will explain what each beer is and tastes like!!.. A+++++++++"
1,"The fries here have just the right amount of crispiness, thickness, and are evenly salted. Try it with the parmesan dipping sauce. Yum! I will definitely be coming back every time I'm in NYC."
0,"We ended up here for New Year's Eve at the recommendation of a friend, of a friend! It was fantastic! Wonderful service from the coat check to the bus-boys/water servicers to the waiter. The real deal here is the prix-fix meal. You get either an antipasto plate or a Caesar salad plus three house made pastas. You don't get to pick the pastas--they are selected in the kitchen as the pastas of the day. All three were fantastic...and, if you can believe it...they are all you can eat! They kept coming around offering more though we had a tough time finishing our original portions. ALL the wines...yes, ALL, are price at $25 a bottle. A steal in any community! We descried what we were looking for to our waiter and her returned with a perfect wine for us. Highly recommended by our group. Food was excellent and piping hot, breads were delicious, salad and antipasto plate wonderful. All in all, an excellent experience and we would happily return."
0,best chile rellenos anywhere! and i've been around the world.  surprisingly great hole in the wall! easy st pkg. pleasant neighborhood.
1,"Even though the lines can extend down the block, service is fast and food is FRESH! And once you're seated and enjoyed your pie, if you'd like to order another one hosts are only happy to accommodate. One of the few places that can actually say ""less is more"". Their pizzas pack so much flavor and their crust is amazing."
1,"I've been here a few times now. I always sit at the sushi bar and order directly from the chefs. Every time, I've had the same experience-- no one on the east coast beats their nigiri. NO ONE. Very traditional style. Extremely fresh fish. Wish they had a better sake selection. Definitely on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. Service is okay-- could be better. Food quality is definitely a 5! I wish they had ama ebi. why are you always out?WHY?? But service, prices, ambiance combined, 4 stars it is."
1,"By far one of my favorite places ever. Right around the corner from my apartment. I go at least once every two weeks, even if I go by myself ! :) Their daily soup specials are to die for. My boyfriend always orders the steak special and I always get some sort of fish or seafood. The scallops are cooked to perfection all the time. Brunch is legit! The mimosas are huge and the biscuit & gravy dish is delicious. The potato bowl is great too. Friendly staff!"
0,I know I have already written a review in the past but I had to write another one. Every time I have come to Buttermilk Channel I continue to fall more in love. I love this place more and more every time I come... You must try the pecan french toast unbelievably good and the lamb on the brunch menu; holy cow this is amazing when I'm taking the bite I almost feel seduced by the flavors really good... lol amazing love this place... We were on our way to try another spot but found us heading over to Buttermilk Channel. Jeannette B
1,There are times the food is just good. And then sometimes you don't want to visit it for a bit. Rasam vadas very good. Try it. It's worth the trip.
0,"I know just open a place called ""Bandwagon""  and everybody will jump on.  THIS PLACE IS NOT THAT GOOD.  If only the flavors matched the attitude. I have come to conclusion that reviewers of NYC barbeque must have a different baseline.  Sad. Well at least i know why it's not called mightee tastee."
0,"i should preface this, and probably all of my yelp reviews by saying i do not have sky high standards.  i've lived in new york my whole life and despite, or maybe because of this, i don't feel like every meal has to be my last.   went here for the first time the other night and echo what other reviewers have said: i like the idea a lot.  and yes, it seems a little pricey, but what do you really expect to pay in the land of all that is hip in 2009?   the best of the pizzas we ordered was the margherita, and yes, i'm sure that's misspelled.  it was simple and tasty, the right amount of slightly sweet sauce and salty cheese.  me likey. it's a bit of a trek for me, but if i lived around there, i'm sure i'd get take out all the time.  i wish yelp could do 1/2 stars, cause this a three and halfer for me."
1,The food is delicious. I had no complaints except for the Agave Glazed Chicken Wings. They were just so-so. Otherwise excellent food. I highly recommend the Fried Goat Cheese with lavender infused honey.
0,"I came here a few times. The food was good, and the time I had to wait wasn't so bad. The people are very friendly here. The pizza sauce stands out the most to me because its very fresh and original tasting to me, which is what i look for in a pizza."
1,"I don't understand how this place has 4 stars. I'm here as we speak and the bread was hard and stale, the seating cramped, the pasta undercooked, the prosciutto overcooked, and the menu misleading. I ordered the taglierini aromatici which boasted a garlic and olive oil sauce and what came out was essentially Italian prosciutto noodle soup. If you're going to serve broth, or should at least be in the description. This was no sauce. So disappointed."
1,amazing.
1,"I come from California, where Japanese food is a daily necessity.  I was impressed with this izakaya! Defn. I went on a Tuesday evening and the place was packed, we had to wait for a table for about 20 minutes.  Service was decent, but our waiter was so nice. We ordered: Bottle of Lychee Sake- will definitely be drinking again! Chili Shrimp in Red Sauce- unexpected surprise. Was fabulous, never had anything like it. It was a sweet and tangy. Braised Seaweed- I am a huge fan of seaweed salad, so this was defn. a change, but a good change.  Brought out different flavors of the seaweed. This place is truly a hidden gem!"
0,"nice bar, nice crowd, perfect for a drink with friend"
1,"Overall: 3.5 Ambiance: 4 oh my lord...can we talk about pork buns for a second.  They were absolutely delish!  The best part was I was able to sit at the food bar and watch them prepare the the whole dish right in front of me.  They take these amazing fatty pieces of pork and saute them in that spicy, yet a little sweet sauce and layer it with a couple pieces of lettuce and a spicy mayo and stuff it in a bun.  The bun was warm and amazing. I also ended up watching the chefs fill up their bottle full ""spicy mayo"" with something that looked like kewpie-that amazing Japanese mayo)  After some digging, I guess there is a version of kewpie that has mustard in it (karashi), so I'm pretty sure that's what they used in their mayo sauce. Either way..it was bomb.  The pork was cooked to perfection and warmed up the lettuce and mayo to make the perfect bite.  This was definitely good stuff. Now...on to the main dish.  I tried the Akura Modern with the addition of Nitamago (seasoned salt boiled egg).  The egg was simple delicious, they cooked it just enough so that the cook was still in a cross between solid and runny.  It was perfect and made me smile =).  The ramen was delicious, but the broth was wayyy too salty for my liking.  I don't know if they put msg in there, but it sure taste like it.  It got to the point, where i just stopped eating even though my stomach wasn't completely satisfied.  Ease up on the salt, or whatever sodium based product you're using.  It's killing the dish. Overall, the place was pretty good.  The pork buns are definitely worth the trip down here.  Ramen, I was pretty disappointed in, but the egg saved a part of the dish. Overall, the restaurant was a 3.5. The overall ambiance was super cool.  Everyone, including non-Japanese waiters & chefs, spoke Japanese!  It seemed like it was a pre-req to work there.  They would greet every customer in Japanese when they walked in the restaurant, and genuinely seemed excited that customers were coming in.  The restaurant definitely had a Japanese Sushi/Bar place that gave a cool vibe!"
1,"delicious brunch, lovely atmosphere! Coconut pancakes w/ ricotta were great but I wish there was more coconut involved then the shavings on top. Still good nonetheless and the waitress was very attentive and friendly."
0,"Here's the bottom-line: Best pork dumplings anywhere, hands down. My friends and I also tried their Sesame Chicken, Beef and Brocoli, and Garlic Beef and were all very impressed. It is ridiculously busy but how could it not be with great food. The waiting staff is not the best as the 18% gratuity is built into every bill, no matter the group size. I would recommend coming here for a great lunch as you are whisked in and out fairly quickly. The food is great, fairly inexpensive, and right in the heart of Chinatown."
0,"Always an excellent choice, whether in the theatre district or the east side locations.  Lively, noisy, but delicious.  The white sangria disappeared so quickly that two pitchers were consumed by four people in no time.  Definitely will return."
0,We ordered food based on these reviews!  We were so happy with the food!  It was delicious and plentiful.  Very affordable.  We ordered online three hours before we needed it and called up to confirm that we wanted it delivered another time.  The food arrived exactly the time we wanted!  We will definitely order from Tina's again while visiting tia in NYC!!!
0,"A shadow of its former self. The wait staff are rude and unhelpful. They forgot our order after we waited for over an hour outside. The pizza arrived and it was so salty it was practically inedible. Worst of all, we didn't get an apology. There are plenty of better NYC pizza joints than this."
1,Really really good chicken
1,"I came here on Friday with a friend after many months of wanting to try this place out. The Mami Arepa was definitely my favorite-  roast pork, avocado and white cheese. I also had the Reina-Shredded chicken, mixed with avocado, and little mayo(it's actually a lot of mayo). The Yuca bites are also really good.  Me and my friend ordered four Arepas and waited about 35-40 mins for our food while every table around us ordered, ate and left. We're pretty sure the server forgot to put in our order. Really annoying but despite the lengthy wait time and flaky service, I'm willing to give this place another chance.I definitely want to come back for brunch!"
0,"I've been to Becco numerous times and always had a good experience. Food has alsways been very good to excellent. Definitely make reservations as this place is always packed. The service has typically been great! The only complaint I have is the tables are jammed together so you're right on top of each other. 2 tops are squeezed together so that every inch of space is utilized. Although, I had a first date there once and we ended up talking with the couples at the tables on either side of us. Not only did we laugh about how close together we were, we talked and sampled dishes from each others tables!! A first for me...made the date that much better!"
0,"really really long wait, but excellent food.  Pork buns were amazing."
0,"I understand that food delivered is never as good as served hot at the spot.  But I just had a burger and fries delivered that were ice cold, the fries were overdone crunchy rocks and while it was not awful, it certainly was not good."
1,"So glad I checked this place out last Saturday. It exceeded my expectation, especially for Australian cuisine. You don't get the opportunity to eat a lot of Australian/ New Zealand food in New York since its quite rare. However, I've always enjoyed its food since most is grilled, organic and fresh. The Thirsty Koala was no different. In fact all their meat was grass fed and they offered a good amount of Vegan Dishes on their menu. Not that it mattered to me, but it was a nice addition. We started with the Crab Cake appetizer. It was everything a Crab cake should be. Ton of crab and very little of anything else. It was accompanied with a side salad garnished with mango and slaw. Went perfectly with the dish. For the main meal, I ordered the steak tacos and my girlfriend got their Special Halibut. My tacos were legit. 2 came in an order but that was all I needed to be full because each taco had at least 6-8 pieces of steak. The steak was really good too. Not just saying that. It had no fat and was cooked perfect. My gf Halibut was wrapped with potato and baked with  veggies. It was another great dish. We finished our meal with a pound cake that was covered in chocolate and coconut. It was fine but a little dry. If they served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream it would have been a home run. We were both satisfied with everything we ordered. And because their menu offered so many great items and specials we both cant wait to be back and try something different."
1,"The noodle soups here are okay. I've had better. For me, the soup stock is one of the most important part of the dish. If the soup is good I'll want to drink it and finish everything (even if I don't because it's too unhealthy). In this case it was bland. Wouldn't have made much of a difference if I ate the noodles without any soup. Overall the soups are 3/5. Not bad but not great. Fried dumplings here are pretty good though. The sauce for it is one of the better ones around. Would stick mainly with that when ordering.   4/5. As an aside, what's up with their chopsticks? It's doesn't say Lam Zhou on it, nor is it generic chopsticks that don't have any name. Their chopsticks are from other restaurants. I've seen a Malaysian and Japanese restaurant. The chopsticks are actually thick and good quality so I'm not complaining."
0,"Vanessa's Dumping House never disappoints! The dumplings are fresh and nicely made. It's the biggest bang for your buck. 4 dumplings for only a dollar! It's the easiest and simplest lunch, dinner, or late night snack you can have. The line can be long at times but it moves pretty fast. You order what you want and they'll punch out a ticket with a number. Within that time, you either sit around or have a smoke outside. *My stupid friends from Queens and Brooklyn would always order those shit dumplings from those fake take out chinese restaurants and they seem to love it. I find it disgusting! Especially when they use that packet soy sauce. That packet soy sauce ain't even real sauce, it's just water with sodium and food coloring to make it look like soy sauce. You think those small take out chinese restaurants are going to give you real ""soy"" sauce? Hell no! At Vanessa's, they prepare the sauce for you. Soy sauce with vinegar and Sarracha sauce! If your in China Town and you only have a few bucks left in your pocket, goto Vanessa's! A buck can buy you lunch! *By stupid, I just mean how some of you guys think those chinese take out restaurants as real chinese food. That shit is just nasty in so many ways I can't even describe. Your paying like 5 bucks for 8 pieces of old frozen dumplings that is just nothing but skin and barely any meat.  At Vanessa's you can get 20 freshly made dumplings for that price!"
0,"As a big fan of Macaroons, I thought they would be a great gift for friends during the holidays. Having tried many many of the different macaroon brands out there, I can say that that Laduree still is my favorite. The consistency and flavor is a step above the rest. Depending on when you go, be prepared to wait in..."
1,"We stopped in after a show at Radio City Music Hall. My husband ordered veal with eggplant and mozzarella and I had minestrone soup. The veal was extremely tender; it was pretty good, just under seasoned. My soup was different than minestrones I've had before (this had peas and other additions), it was ok, but not worth $8."
0,"Three of us came for dinner last night. I'm afraid our experience wasn't great. The appetizers were OK, although the beets had been prepared earlier and tuna seemed over dressed. My tagliatelle was oily and overladen with garlic, while the chicken was tasty, the mash seemed fussy. While the food approached competent, the service was the clanger, it was like amateur hour. The wait staff couldn't remember two specials without referring to her note pad, couldn't remember who ordered what, and kind of threw the food in front of us. The staff seemed careless and offhand, pity, as they have taken some pains on the decor and the menu. C minus County."
0,"Amazing place!!! Went on a double date as one of two couples here.... we drank like fools, ate like kings and our bill was 100 each couple. seriously, you cant beat that in the city. Anyway, the meat is incredibly fresh, and the the sauces & veggies are spot on. For those looking for a Shabu place in the city, look no further. This place is straight up incredible!"
0,"I love Greek food. But finding a nice Greek place to sit and eat is hard. Kefi is a great place to sit down drink Greek wine, and eat A LOT. There was a little wait when I arrived for the reservation. But the bar was open and close to the waiting area. I went to the bar and asked for a merlot but the barttender told us they only offered Greek wines. He was very good at offering wines that were similar to what I liked and I ended up ordering a bottle at the table. The Hummus appatizer was amazing and came with 5 different kinds to try. I got the Chicken Kabob Gyro which was more than filling. The service was great and let you really enjoy your time there. The only bad thing about this place is that its on the West side"
0,"Like everyone else I've been dying to try this place. Finally, got a chance Saturday night. We sat at what they jokingly called the ""Elvis"" table. Wife had the spiked lemonade which she enjoyed. We ordered the crawfish boudain balls, and I think I found my new addiction. All I can say is WOW. Our entrees were both really good.  The fried chicken with mac and cheese was best I 've had in a  looong time, and the wife really enjoyed the blackened catfish. We were going to skip desert, but the waiter said something about dump cake ( yeah that's what they call it). With a name like that we had to try it. Another winner with cherry, pineapple and cake all mixed (dumped) together. And just as a side note, there's something about this place where you just feel welcome and comfortable, unlike other places on 30th ave. From the funky tables, stuff encased in the bar, and TV cabinet storage?!?!?   Someone really poured the love into this place. Really hope they stick around, because I found my new go to place. And to the whiney snob who gave the place one star because you couldn't get in. Go back to reviewing Wendy's"
1,"I went here for my first time last Friday night. We were in NY for the weekend...we didn't get here until midnight, for dinner! It was packed, we waited by the bar for about 20 min and then we were seated at a cozy corner booth for 2! The service was great, attentive. The food sooooo goood! We had Pig Cheeks and Deviled Eggs to start, and then shared a Burger. Enjoyed a nice bottle of red wine. Managed to hang out until closing....what a cool environment, great food, service, it was a great experience. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in the city!! Cheers."
0,"Mycket god mat, bra service och skön stämning!"
1,"The best C rated restaurant in the city. If you can ignore the scarlet letter it's an adventure worth risking. Dumplings were delish, Tsing Tao was flat. For what it is it was good. Go for the dumplings and ignore the bathroom."
1,"For me, it was the price (good value) and the atmosphere (cozy) that nudged my rating to four stars. Most of the food was good as well. My motivation for writing this review is to warn people not to order the Carciofi Fritti (fried baby artichokes with crispy parsley) appetizer. I was disappointed in this small and nearly tasteless appetizer. Don't waste your money! Our group of 5 also shared: Saute Di Cozze (mussels sauteed with white wine and garlic). Everyone really liked this and the mussels were very tender. We were dipping our bread in the broth at the end. I had the filling Lasagna. Good, though I wish it has some more sauce. My husband had the Fennel Sausage with Cannelloni Beans and he said while the sausage was fair, the beans might  be the best he's ever eaten. The ravioli looked yummy. I got there at 5:45pm on a Friday and several tables were open (no wait). We were lucky to get a table in the back by the kitchen, so we had space and didn't feel like we were crowded or on top of other people. Only 1 bathroom in the restaurant, so if you're coming from a bar or home, you might want to go before you get to the restaurant if you don't want to worry about waiting in line."
0,"Just got finished eating at the ""Counting Room"" on N.11th ,wanted to watch the AFC game and it was only place on my block that had room for  viewing. While sitting at the bar I notice the nice decor and beautiful exposed factory beams.   I'm not a huge wine drinker really, but prefer hard liquor and beer, so instead my date and I order the grilled cheese. Once it arrives I notice the cheese melting out nicely, but once I bite into my expensive $12 sandwich I realize there isn't any in the middle, it's not really hot,  and two cloves of raw garlic sit lonely next to it. I'm not saying this place isn't good for wine, I'm sure it's excellent! It's has nice atmosphere, next time I'll have to try some of the other food items. Also be prepared they min $20 on credit cards, and the possibility of it being a bit brisk inside. (This could have resulted from their enormous grand ceilings)."
0,"We ordered 2 vegetarian platters and they gave us one piece of bread. We kindly asked the waiter for another piece of bread to go along with the other platter and he refused! We called the manager over and he said, ""I don't care if you order one hundred platters, we will not give you another one!"" What kind of service is this? To make a statement like that when each platter is supposed to be accompanied by one piece of bread is ridiculous. Terrible service, terrible attitude."
1,"I'd looked forward to coming to Malatesta for awhile and it disappointed me a bit. The wait was about 45 minutes for a party of two on a Friday. Unfortunately they don't take reservations for parties smaller than four, and if you come here I do recommend a group. In addition to reducing your wait time the spot is also kind of noisy. Tables for two are tiny and a bit haphazardly arranged. I definitely feared for the safety of our wine bottle. We started with the Piadina Mozzarella Pomodoro. I guess this wasn't a researched decision (would have been helpful to know what a piadina was), and I was expecting a traditional caprese platter. What we got instead were these little tortilla sandwiches that highly resembled quesadillas... In fact, yes, it basically was a glorified, Italian quesadilla. Substitute mozzarella for monterey jack. Would pass on this option next time. For my main I did the spinach gnocchi. It definitely tasted homemade - gnocchi was light and pillowy - but I actually would have preferred if the gorgonzola sauce was stronger. It tasted more like a ordinary cream sauce to me. My friend got the Tagliatelle al Ragu, which tasted pretty generic. Overall, prices extremely reasonable for this West Village charmer, but alas the food is not memorable enough to warrant repeat visits, and definitely not a 45-minute wait on a cold NYC night."
1,"Just ask for the breakfast bacon and the pork or brisket and you will thank me. Also, their ice cream literally made me cry. And Whiskey. Whiskey EVERYWHERE!"
1,"It's a very cute and romantic place, the only problem is that it's way too LOUD at night! You won't be able to have a conversation. It's honestly a shame but if you go during the afternoon it's a little better."
1,"This is by far the best old world type pizza I have had.  The sauce is simple and the cheese is so fresh.  We ate here as the first stop on a pizza tour.  Although hunger allowed me to love the following two pizzerias on the tour, this place is special."
0,"Food - 5 Stars Service - 3 stars: No reservations, wait times can be about an hour on the weekend. Service staff seems ""snooty"" which is odd given the price range of the restaurant. Environment - 4 stars: Very nice, dark lighting, can be crowded at times without being claustrophobic"
0,Horrible customer service. Placed order on phone and waited over 40 minutes. I spoke with one of the workers and asked him what happen with my order. He told me to wait outside and he would get back with me but kept ignoring me. Didn't have a chance to have my lunch.
0,"I had another great experience at Landmarc recently.  I used to live in Tribeca and frequent Landmarc often, having moved about a year ago, I recently went back with a group of colleagues.   We had a great table and were seated promptly.  We ordered a few bottles of wine which were nice and relative in price to others.  To start we had calamari and mozzarella, ricotta and zucchini fritters.  For entrees we had a variety of dishes, I had filet mignon which was perfectly cooked - really good piece of meat.  For dessert we shared Landmarc's dessert sampling which was also good.  The service throughout the night was very good, never had to ask for anything, our server always anticipated requests and , made recommendations for portions."
1,"I am not a fan of macarons, but I would have their caramel fleur de sel any day. Pistachio and vanilla seem to be popular, since they were sold out when I got there. I wouldn't wait for 2 hours in line. Go on a Monday and the wait is about 20-30 mins."
1,"It's taken me a little over 2 years to finally make it to Grimaldi's.  My friend and I decided to make it a Brooklyn outing day by walking the BK bridge and eating at Grimaldi's.  I've passed by Grimaldi's several times during my time in NY, but having always seen a line, never wanted to wait.  This day, however, I was dedicated.  The line was maybe 15-20 ppl long but it moved surprisingly fast.  Within 30 minutes we had a table.  It's a pretty tiny place inside, so think eating in Chinatown elbow to elbow with random strangers.  My friend and I ordered a small pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  I had high hopes and they were quickly deflated.  The pizza crust wasn't even that thin and it was soggy/runny.  I'm a pretty easy person to please when it comes to pizza as long as it's made right.  I'm not a fan of the runny/watery pizza that you have to eat with a knife and fork because you can't even pick it up.  That is what we were served at Grimaldi's.  Two thumbs down in my book.  Though it wasn't the worst pizza I've ever had in my life, it definitely didn't live up to the hype.  For great thin-crust pizza, I would say head to Luzzo's, Posto, or Lombardi's."
1,"Champs, you are hands down my favorite place to eat. Birthday dinner? Let's go to Champs! Time to celebrate finishing my degree? Champs it is! You are also the best vegan joint to introduce to skeptical friends. You know, the ones who think my diet is solely comprised of wheat grass and leafy, unsatisfying salads. I have never walked away from you hungry. In fact, I usually have to take a stroll in an attempt to walk off part of the meal. I've been coming back ever since you opened and you continue to be a source of temptation, comfort, and delight. Your extra thick and steamy sandwiches! Those breakfast slams you pile on my plate!  Your finger-licking-good treats poised coquettishly behind the baked-goods case! Champs, I think I love you. (Well, you and your sweeter than honey waitresses!)"
1,"My friend and I are regular visitors to Chelsea, but we are always on the Gallery Run and never stopped for a sit-down dinner at The Red Cat until last night. (Alright, I admit it was the BBE code that finally got me in there for something other than drinks.) I will definitely be back. Cocktails were great - one of the better Manhattans I have had in a restaurant, with decent cured cherries rather than faux-red maraschinos. I smashed my glass on the ground when I was just about done (unintentionally) and they couldn't have been nicer - cheerfully cleaning up and pouring me a whole new drink. I had an appetizer of soft-shell crab over papaya salad (very good); Michael had asparagus risotto (Mikey liked it!). You might not like calf's liver but I do. And if you taste Red Cat's version you will be converted. Spectacular blend of flavors, with a leek tart, ""melted tomatoes"" (a thick paste of fresh-roasted fruit), and a balsamic reduction building a rich dish that made me remember the best rustic meals I have had in Italy and southern France. Michael had salmon, which sounded so boring to me I didn't even taste it, but he raved about it the rest of the night so I guess I missed something special. The pistachio semifredo, sweet and rich with a nice hit of salty crunch around each nut, was a sublime end to one of the better restaurant meals I have had in months. The waitress (tall and thin and always smiling - even though she knew I was on a coupon, even when she was mopping up my drink and broken glass) was so perfectly attentive, without ever rushing us, that I tipped her 25%. Go."
1,"It is not as good as it once was but still perfect for quick simple dishes.  The roast pork, chicken, ribs and duck can be purxhased by the pound to take home for a fast meal, just add rice at home or order it if you are lazy like me. They alsi make some dim sum that you can order to eat in or take our but there is no lady pushing a cart here.  It is still pretty good and enjoyable just the same. You can sit in and dine as well in the back with table service.  If you really luke congee, itbis still good.  They also have fried dough that you can enjoy with your congee.  The other recommendation I say you have to try is the roast pork ribs.  It is still good and very tasty but you have to get dirty and use your hands. Good unassuming place that serves good food at a decent price.  Just don't use their washrooms."
0,"all time favorite spot!!!!!! try the rack of lamb, it is absolutely delicious. all of the desserts are phenomenal but the chocolate torte blows everything away. If you're here on vacation this is definitely Thee spot to visit."
0,"I've been to Momofuku on a couple of occasions and I am just not that impressed, especially for the price. This past week a friend and I ordered the pork buns (delicious, as always), the chanterelles with quail eggs, and pork shoulder. The last two were completely underwhelming. For $18, two quail eggs and a handful of lightly seasoned mushrooms was not quite what I was expecting, and the pork shoulder was nothing I couldn't have easily made at home. Grilled with no seasoning except salt and pepper, a side of chimichurri, and a hominy cake. Meh. My friend and I both agreed that we'd be just as well to get three orders of pork buns and a couple cornflake marshmallow cookies next time - those are the only things that are worth repeated trips to Momofuku and are more than worth the price."
0,"Wolf + Deer is a GREAT BAR. well, it is for me, and so i think probably for you too. One of the very nice things about it - besides the wine, cocktails and MOST IMPORTANTLY TO ME beer! - is that they encourage you to stay a little while, hang loose with your friends and family. i went the first week and it was nice and the service was good although did not have a traditional American pace to it (opposite experience of what i think another reviewer was saying about rushing the check).and then my second visit was a few days ago and everything had improved. i think it will always be getting better. cheers to wolf + deer!"
0,"The entire time I was thinking, wow I'm a hypocrite, I don't eat my mom's pig feet but here, I'm dogging everything down. :D $38 prix fixe = yellowtail sashimi, pork salad on mesclun greens, grilled pig feet/knuckles, fried chicken, shabu shabu (dumplings, bacon, more pig feet and knuckles, chives, cabbage, tofu), bibimbap rice + egg, strawberry ice cream, mochi (WHOA), tea.... add a $20 sake.... I dreamt happy dreams that night."
1,"Honestly, you can't compare this place to Baoguette other than by the fact that the portions at Baoguette are larger. The bread has the right amount of crisp to tenderness. I'd recommend the pulled pork for novices (pork belly is a bit too greasy in my opinion). The corn is bomb. I wish the location on 41st St. and Lex had a place to sit."
0,"Great drinks, food and atmosphere any night of the week!"
0,"I went to Yerba Buena for dinner with a friend early on a Monday night, after finding the wait time 2 hours for two people on a Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised by the very friendly waitstaff and excellent food. Carlos was our waiter- giving us wonderful recommendations on our cocktails and even promising that we would like the cocktails he suggested otherwise he would take it back and make us a different one of our choosing. Needless to say that didn't happen because they were all delicious. The Pisco Guava was amazing and the Jalapeno Cucumber one had the perfect amount of kick and the fresh cucumber lightness to it matched with the Gin. We had the blue corn calamari and the potato croquettes to start, The potato croquettes were delicious and creamy with a truffle dipping sauce and the calamari was crispy and perfectly breaded and seasoned. Next we tried the Ceviche which was ok but  I would try something else next time.  I would definitly want to go back and try the brunch. Great overall experience, highly recommended."
1,"As others have mentioned, the food here is tremendous. Beware of the ""Large"" portions as they are indeed LARGE. Both the Cajun Shrimp and the Curry Vegetables were savory and full of flavor. Cooked in coconut milk, the shrimp themselves were a particular standout amongst the mix. Not much comfort in the seating options though. Up a tight, steep flight of metal stairs is a small indoor dining area. In the summer, it is hot & steamy with some flies (not ideal by any means). If you can score one of the 2 tiny tables outside, as we were lucky to do so, you're golden. Next time I'm visiting the BK Museum, I'll probably be back at The Islands. P.S. I bet delivery would be awesome. The longer the food sits, the more the rice and other items soak up the flavors."
1,"My cocktail was bloody gross, The dishes weren't memorable, but all I do remember is how un impressed I was. Come on Highlands represent Scotland and make the food with more love. The only thing I do remember being really delicious is the small little dinner roll that they serve.  That was done very well."
0,"To all you haters, who dis Jimmy's taters: You just don't understand. Yes, they are unconventional, but it's cause they've taken taters to a whole new level. Jimmy's = Tater Heaven. Oh, and the owner is really cute, too."
0,"A colleague, a member of our top brass and I decided to lunch at Antinori. We were seated by the owner who, after offering us a table, came back and reeled of a list of specials with panache, far too many for us to keep track of. All I remembered was something with clams and steaks. Anyway, after speaking about the choices amongst ourselves, when he came back to take our order and saw us dithering he suggested that we have a seafood starter with a bit of everything and steak and veal as our main course. Of course, the bread arrived and was good. What I particularly liked was the fact that unlike most restaurants they had butter knives, which to me epitomizes a great restaurant. Some miscellaneous accompaniments for drinks arrived and were good. They changed our forks and knives after we had had these starters. (I, particularly, hate it when servers put the used forks and knives down on the tablecloth). Then the main seafood starter arrived. There were two clams, each in a different sauce, a giant shrimp in it's own sauce and a calamari. I wish I had taken a photograph because the plate presentation was exquisite. Each item on the starter had been cooked perfectly and was excellent. I thought that I should have made it my main course too. Just as well I didn't. Then they changed our forks and knives again! The veal and a giant T-Bone arrived. The veal was good and might have been great on it's own. However, it paled in comparison to the T-Bone which was fantastic.The server put the T-Bone plate facing away from us and the owner came and corrected the positioning. He proceeded to serve us from the main plate. The steak was cooked to perfection and easily ranked amongst the best steaks I have eaten. Nobody had space for dessert but we decided to have some coffee. By this time the table cloth had lost it's initial pristine look despite the fact that the server had continued to pick up crumbs and debris created during our meal. Rather than letting us drink our coffee on the now grungy tablecloth, they brought a fresh one, rolled it up and then unrolled it onto the old tablecloth making the table look great again! Everything was done with great style and panache and the food was wonderful. Do I plan on going back? Definitely. In fact, I plan to take my family there for my son's birthday next month. Do I recommend this restaurant? Absolutely!"
1,"This restaurant has the best quality/price ratio in the entire New York City. I ordered 8 fried dumplings, 1 beef pan cake, and one soy milk, and the total cost is $5. Very very crowded, and not easy to find a seat at any time. But you can always eat while mobile, so no need to sit down. The dumplings are good, but not perfect, but good. The pancake is so-so. The soy milk is good. But with the price, they are perfect. Much better than eating garbage like McDonald's or KFC, American garbage food."
0,One of my favorite sake bar in NYC
0,"This place is awesome! I have only had the crab but it is sooooo good, makes me not want to try anything else. I recommend getting all of the seasonings together. Only thing that sucks is they do not take reservations so you most likely will be waiting for a while (depends on what day and time you go). They do make up for it by sending you a text when your table is ready so you don't have to wait in the restaurant. It does get crowded. Love love love the place."
0,The food is good specially shwarma and the Kibbi.. But the last time I went the kibbi was not good as before... but I like this place
1,"The food will make you slap your mama! The service will make you kick her while she's down.  Awesome Restaurant all around. I went with two friends we had pancakes, the eggs with apple platter, and their smoked salmon on greens platter. It was so delicious and the service was 6 stars and it came with a drink.  Yaaaaay! Loved our waiter (and he had a cute accent) and the greeter. Well worth the wait for a table. The body Mary's are some ofthe Best I've tasted and the price is very reasonable. Our great waiter took pictures of us and was quite the character and a great cellphone photographer. He really earned that tip. Go there now!"
0,"I live literally a 10 min walk from this place. This place has their own pizza take out, spumoni/ice stand, and restaurant. Delicious pizza and pasta. Whether you eat at the outdoor seating provided or dine in at the restaurant, the place is just good. 70 year old run business, and their sauce is just awesome."

Next visit will be brunch. !!!  And soon!!!"
0,"I didn't think that British food and yummy could be used in a sentence together until I went to the Spotted Pig. April Bloomfield is the super talented chef behind the deliciousness of this gastro pub. The popularity of the Spotted Pig has started a whole trend of people milling towards gastro pubs in the city. This little bohemian spot in the West Village offers seasonal British and Italian dishes on its menu, which are adapted from popular pub food. Just try their killer Gnudi, which are these ""to die for"" dumplings made with sheep's milk ricotta. Their deviled eggs are divine as is their outstanding Banoffee pie for dessert. The Spotted Pig is just one of those places that you cannot get enough off. I think I can safely say...that I'm hooked!!"
0,I loved everything about this place from the owner to the food and atmosphere. The Cheesecake was excellent. Loving the grilled octopus. The spinach with feta was delicious.
1,"The food here is incredible! I was here for a bachelorette dinner and every time our server brought a new plate of food, conversation stopped and our taste buds swooned! Among the dishes we shared were: -Fried Goat Cheese with lavender infused honey -Pan-Blistered Shishito Peppers (Turkish Kashkaval cheese, pomegranate molasses, sumac) -Crispy Brussels Sprouts (fuji apples, crème fraiche, pistachio nuts) SO FREAKING YUMMY! -Grilled Shrimp & Chorizo Skewer (avocado cream, warm garlic & sherry vinaigrette) -Squid Ink Paella (mixed shellfish, preserved lemon, guindillas peppers & scallions) -Skirt Steak with Chimichurri, parmesan potato puree, haricot vert & tomato salad In addition to amazing food, our server Grace was phenomenal. She anticipated our needs, granted any additional requests for water or food, and put up with our raucous laughter. Grace won even more points with me when I pointed out that a couple of us at the table could not eat gluten (we're Paleo) and Grace supplied us with a gluten-free menu! The gluten-free menu was a breakout list of items from the regular menu that contain no gluten. Perfect! That little bit of help made our dining experience that much better. I would definitely eat here again the next time I'm in New York. I'd love to come here with my husband (rather than a large party) so we could concentrate on the yummy food!"
1,"From the moment you step up to this restaurant and pull on the door handle shaped like a butcher knife, you know you're about to go absolute primal. I'm actually going to start with the service first. Can the waitresses get any more friendlier? On top of that they were cute as hell. Ya know what, I gotta stop with the waitress-love in my recent reviews. Let this be the last. A very well deserved last :P When Lori L pulled out her camera, the waitress even offered to re-arrange the plates for us so she could have a better shot (what??) You don't need a maitre in full suit to make you feel pampered and Butcher Bar exemplies that. We went for the butcher platter.  That's 1/4 pound of any three meats plus two sides for 28 dollars. Big enough for two. If not, pull up that Yelp app and check in. Now you have a free side. Celebrate. For the carnivores with a big appetite, its definitely possible to down the whole thing yourself. All the meat piled up together probably equates to a 14 oz steak (Asian'ed that thing). Go for your favorite meats but be sure to get the burnt ends. I mean... they're considered one of the best if not the best bbq in Queens so you're going to look sillier than John Smith ordering Pu Pu Platter in China if you don't hook yourself up with some burnt ends. Lori ate almost all of it. She had a fever at the time. If you're looking at fall off the bone ribs, be sure to call first. They may run out (they always eventually do.) Two out of three times I've been there we were offered some form of free dessert. Its a place with lots of good meat, made by a very recognized BBQ chef. I'm not going to get all up on your manliness by giving you suggestions on your meats (except try the burnt ends.) It's a very relaxing place with great value and enjoyed by everyone I've taken here."
1,"*This review is broken up into Overall Verdict (Summary), Experience/Service and Food details. ---------Overall Verdict: Service: Average Venue: Classy and cozy, dimly lit spot; there is jazz music with black and white movies projected on the brick walls Food: Relatively pricey with decent portions Additional details: There is an outdoor patio seating available and a bar in the middle. Verdict: Low-key atmosphere that's perfect for a small gathering or date but it's a little too much on the pocket for the portions and quality they provide. ---------Experience/Service: I came here with a girlfriend on a Monday night around 5:30pm with no reservation. We were seated immediately to the side on a comfy couch booth by the window. It was pretty early to have dinner as per New York standard, and although it wasn't packed, the place was very much beaming with life. As the night grew on, more and more patrons came into this almost speakeasy-like place (except that it's a bit bigger than what I'd normally categorize as a speakeasy). I loved the 20's vibe and decor. The place has brick-walls with black and white movies projected onto them while jazz music plays in the background. The staff are kind but nothing extraordinary to note about. ---------Food: As per our waiter's recommendations, we tried the Tuna Tar Guac appetizer and Green Pasta with Shrimp entrée. We also tried the Lamb Chops. - Tuna Tar Guac (tuna, guacamole, onions, tomato, broccoli and lime juice) - a good light appetizer. They initially start off with four large chips, but they will give you more once you run out. - Green Pasta (creamy spinach tagliatelle pasta with marinated shrimp)  - it was a bit too sweet for me, but nevertheless delectable. It only comes with 4 pieces of shrimp. - Lamb Chops (grilled with avocado, sheery vinaigrette salad and blue cheese) - amazing! So tender and very succulent!"
1,"Food is not that great. Pizzas were good, pasta fagioli was terrible."
1,"Strategically located next to Van Leeuwen's ice cream, this joint is not to be missed.  My sandwich with whole wheat bread and stuffed with white meat chicken, carrots, daikon, cilantro.  Yumtastic!  The price was right too....cheap!  When you're done, walk next door to Van Leeuwen and cap off your meal with some delicious (but pricey) ice cream."
1,Worst tourist trap ever. Don't go. I'd rather eat a toilet puck.
0,We were in from Philadelphia and  had a wonderful dinner! The pizza was out of this world. Great service and wine selection with a down home feel. Fresh home made food.
0,"Get the artichoke pizza.  It is the best pizza I've ever had, ever.  Its well worth the $4.00 they charge."
0,"I've come here for dinner a couple times and every time it's been delicious. We got the lamb tagine and the chicken tagine. Huge portion, and soooo good. Love the atmosphere too"
0,"Delicious! And the waitstaff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Honestly the nicest hostess and waitress that I've met in a very long time. The food came out at just the right time-- not too fast as though they're trying to hurry things along and not too slow so it doesn't get awkward for you and your guest. I feel like their vegetarian option is lacking so that may be something to watch out for if people in your party don't eat meat. The filet mignon with foie gras is absolutely delicious! Just the right portion size too."
1,"After being to northern Thailand, the food here definitely brings back memories. A great place for anyone who wants a taste of authentic northeastern thai cuisine. I'm definitely going back."
0,"Just returned from a great day in NYC and enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Tony's. First time there and  think I liked it even better than Carmines- which is my usual go to NYC restaurant. Same idea- HUGE  portions- you must share. Party of 3- split Tony's Salad and Chicken Scarpariello- Absolutely delicious- plus we had leftovers. The white sangria was light and fruity- Totally hit the spot.  Would highly recommend a visit. I am sure it gets very crowded, so reservations are a must."
0,"Every single dish here I've tried has been excellent!  My boyfriend and I made it a mission to eat here midst a ""monsoon"" that hit Brooklyn suddenly during August.  Even though we were drenched down to our socks, we enjoyed every single bite.  Next time I'll have to try their cocktails. I agree with other Yelpers that the crowd and atmosphere is a good one... mixed and relaxed."
1,"Great food, atmosphere, and staff! It's a neighborhood gem. They make you feel at home, you are treated well, and the food and wine is delish."
1,"I can only speak for the lychee martinis. Strong, yummy, and gets the job done."
0,"I love this place. Their lunch specials can be as cheap as $6.90 - and for a huge plate of delicious green curry, plus spring rolls, I'm a happy camper! Delicious and fairly inexpensive."
0,"Very good pizza pies! Listen up, there is NO reason why restaurants, in particular trendy and expensive places like this do no take credit cards. For this reason, I am knocking two stars off of the review. I straight up just think it's audacious to have a business only be cash only (ESPECIALLY when they have an ATM in there clunking up a corridor)! It's just very inconvenient. To some, it's fine, but for me it kind of made my visit stressful. I prefer barboncino because they accept cards, and their prices are more modest for a similar pie and experience."
1,"Same great food as the other locations, less wait! I've been three times and have yet to wait for a table, love the bar area, occasionly stop in for a veggie plate snack! The ambiance is bright and cheery."
0,"I've been here many times and have never been disappointed. The food is excellent and prices are amazing. Yes it is a little crowded, with tables close together, but for the price it is understandable that they have to fit as many people in there as they can, and it's really not that bad. I believe it is under new ownership now but that the menu and everything is going to stay the same. Being Italian I usually don't like to eat out at Italian restaurants but this is great food with a menu coming straight from Italy. I'm looking forward to going back on my next trip to the city. Bon appetit!"
1,"3.5 stars.  I only ordered a few things from here, so I may round up if things are better next time.  I got the greek yogurt with apricots, which was to die for.  I give this 5 stars and I would come back just for this.  I paid $7 for a container that was about 5 or 6 inches wide.  Expensive, but worth it. Then I got a wrap (tzatziki chicken), which I give 2 stars.  All of the substantive ingredients were loaded in the front, so it looked like there was a lot more stuffing inside than there actually was!  The entire back half of the wrap only had lettuce.  Very deceptive and I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known.  The wrap was $5.   Like other reviewers have mentioned, I also get the feeling that prices are made up on the fly."
1,Super hot sauce! the combo is awesome
1,"Famous for japanese ramen and a long waiting line. As I expected, the place was crowded with people waiting for the seats but we ordered some drinks and waiting wasn't that bad but it was probably because we went pretty early. We ordered some pork buns and this sparkling sake recommended by the waitress and it was delicious. Pork buns were pretty good too. I feel like this place may be overrated but my experience here was good and overall everything was pretty satisfying. I would go back here again or the new ippudo in midtown to try more things."
0,"Came here for dinner on NYE after reading good reviews and hearing that they were BYOB. We were able to reserve a table a day in advance. Their decor and everything looked good and brand new, even their bathroom smelled good. There was no corkage fee for the champagne and cider we brought, and they even offered a bucket of ice to chill the champagne. Most of the menu was very reasonable for NYC, and they had a special that included 2 appetizers, an entree, mochi, and a tokkuri of sake (about 5 shots) all for 25$. I'm not a Japanese/Thai food connoisseur, but everything tasted good. Excellent prices, good service, good food."
1,"From what I can tell this place is always packed! Over an hour wait for a table for 2 on a Saturday night. They texted us when the table was ready. Waited at the outside bar where music was playing loudly and people were all over the place. Cool spot....entertaining. Nice little tap beer selection, extensive by the bottle wine selection, bartenders were awesome people. Pizza was delicious! Classic margherita and then a bee sting pie! Sweet and spicy. If you don't mind busy loud fun environment, and you want some good eats, I'd say give this place a checking out. The service was remarkable, everyone who worked there seemed to enjoy it and that's important on its own. It reflects off of them and makes for a great time."
1,"Now THIS is the way brunch should be. With Bikini Season approaching, one must go on an AYCD hiatus, but still be able to enjoy all of the perks of brunch.  I arrived to Cookshop a little bit earlier than my reservation and watched in awe as yummy cocktails were prepared for various tables.  ""Okay,"" I thought.  ""I'll have just one.  ONLY ONE."" When two of my favorite ladies and dining companions were seated with me, we realized our decision would be more difficult than previously thought.  ""Which one?""  White peach bellinis?  Mimosas?  Mottled strawberry caipirinhas?  Caipirinhas it was!  And they didn't disappoint.  Lots of boozy strawberry and sugar cane goodness. Our entree decisions were equally as difficult.  Frittata?  Cookshop scramble?  French toast?  I opted for the frittata and it was delicious - the perfect amount of brussel sprouts and parmesan cheese although the eggs were only slightly overdone.  I couldn't resist a bite of the Cookshop scramble. Eff the Bikini Body, I'm totally getting this next time. A definite plus: no one was looking to kick us out after we finished our meal.  It could have been that our waiter was intrigued by our discussion of Ed Hardy underpants but who knows..."
0,"One of the finest bars in Brooklyn. One of the best lattes I've ever had. It's rare to find a place that's at its best at all hours of operation. You will never once see any member of the exceptional Heavy Woods staff waiting around for prime time to strike and treating you as an afterthought in the meantime. You immediately feel that these people love their community and will slake your thirst to the best of their ability. I'm just a few blocks away and, whether it's for my morning coffee or closing down the bar, I find this place to be a true credit to the neighborhood, though I would travel long distances for the same experience. Brilliantly planned and kept, the only thing the owners have proven incapable of is hiring a single inept or unfriendly bartender. Everyone is phenomenally attentive, skilled and friendly. It's the kind of bar where the bartenders will call out the window to you as you're passing by and welcome you with a kind shout when you stop in. Grumpy Coffee is the house brew and the original cocktail menu is the best I've seen in a while. Excellent music, warm atmosphere and the occasional film choice is always unexpected and enjoyable. The only downside to Heavy Woods is how it prevents me from discovering new bars. See you there tonite!"
1,"My hipster friend, Victor M., told me to check out The Queens Kickshaw, saying it was the best grilled cheese he has ever had. Normally, I don't listen to hipsters. The hipsters I know go with whatever is trendy at the moment and their lack of an attention span rivals a goldfish, but Victor is a very old friend that once listened to me tell the same story five times, so I owed it to him. The storefront is unassuming (i.e. to find the restaurant, I had to count from 40-11, 40-13, etc). I stepped in with the girl and it immediately gave off that hipster ambiance. The restaurant was bumping house, I saw five laptops (all of them Apple) and people studying for their tests, while drinking a beer. I never knew how this really worked, but I didn't drink beer while studying in college and I wasn't an A-plus student, so maybe I missed the train on that one. Anyway, we sat down and ordered the two beers, the Gruyere, the Gouda, Tomato Soup and Curried Pumpkin Seeds. The restaurant has an extensive beer and wine menu and the Curried Pumpkin Seeds was a great pairing. For me, the seeds were more candied than curried as they were sweet to the taste, but spiced to the scent. The small bowl for $4 felt bottomless. For those that don't know, grilled cheese and tomato soup pretty much go together like milk and cookies, peanut butter and jelly and other complementary comfort foods. The tomato soup was chunky and felt homemade. They didn't use any cream, which is a more familiar pairing with grilled cheese, but no complaints as the soup remained piping hot even though it was served as an appetizer. My friend got the Gruyere with caramelized onions on rye. The cheese was great - nice and thick - but the caramelized onions really shined. The way Queens Kickshaw pickled and caramelized their onions is indescribable, but it brought out the full flavor of the vegetable. My Gouda, made with black bean hummus, guava jam, and pickled jalepenos, was just as complex as its description. First, you taste the sweetness of the gouda, amplified by the guava jam, then comes the spiciness of the pickled jalepenos. The brioche the sandwich was made with was also fluffy yet perfectly grilled. So many grilled cheese restaurants press the sandwich to melt the cheese, so in the end you get the anorexic version of a true grilled cheese, but at Queens Kickshaw, the cheese was perfectly melted, yet the bread remained airy and grilled. The restaurant easily had the best grilled cheese I have ever had the pleasure to eat, but it was a little pricey, even more expensive than some Manhattan locations (Melt Shop, Gorilla Cheese). With a wide selection of drinks and bar eats, The Queens Kickshaw is a perfect restaurant to start off a date, then transition into something more extensive, if you can find the next location in this neighborhood."
0,"I had ordered cheeseburger deluxe from this place Well done meat with sauteed mushroom, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes were the toppings I had.  Buns are dry and the meat just tasted old and nasty.  I would never eat here again.  Just a tourist attaraction place with high price and low service/quality."
0,"The noodles were perfect, the broth delicious.  The dumplings were out of this world and the seaweed salad gets two thumbs up.  All of this at a great price. Best place in Chinatown.  This will be a regular stop for me."
1,This place was really cute and the staff were friendly and competent. Unfortunately the food didn't live up to the adorable decor. It wasn't expensive but not cheap enough to be as completely uninteresting as it was. I had fried eggs with toast and home fries...and that's exactly what I got. My friend had an omelette which wasn't hot and the cheese hadn't even melted. There wasn't anything really bad about the food but with all the interesting food in New York it doesn't seem worth it.
1,"Love this place.  The $5 classic banh mi is a go-to...  I love the flavor and spiciness and the size is ridiculous for $5.  The pho is great, too.  I've been several times for lunch and it's never been a miss. If you come during a weekday, make sure to do it early because it fills up fast."
0,"Go go curry is amazing! We love the food there. And imagine this kind of restaurant near time square - it's affordable and tasty. My friend, who never enjoyed curry before, liked the curry here. I ordered Grand Slam, which contained five kinds of meat and it was amazing and the portion was enough for me. Anyway we loved it!"
0,"By far the best of the Family Style Italian restaurants in the city. Great Southern Italian cuisine...it's all about the sauce. Take a date, take your boss, take your family...they'll love you for it. I bring clients here all the time. The food is amazing, the atmosphere jumping, and it's a great place to make a memory. The meatballs and sausage platter will drive you insane."
1,"I came here last week on a double date and had a great experience. First off, the place is very small with only a handful of tables that seat 2 or 4 people, and one larger communal table that maybe seats 8 people. This is fine, but if you arrive before the rest of your party you have to wait at the bar (also tiny, maybe 5 seats) to be seated. So come early! Anyway, we ordered some guacamole for the table and it was so fresh and delicious - so were the chips that came with it. For my entree, I ordered the Cazuela De Mariscos (tilapia and shrimp in a chipotle tomato sauce), which came with some bread. The dish is smokey and spicy, and very flavorful. The service was good - our waitress was friendly but also became a little pushy as the restaurant got busier - clearly trying to hurry us up. Either way, it wasn't so bad that it ruined the experience, and I would love to go back to try more - including some drinks next time, which looked delicious."
0,"The tacos here have been amazing every time I've been here, which is often! The Al Pastor tacos are so good. So cheap and so good."
0,"I want to qualify this review by saying that I've worked in restaurants before, and that kitchens have off nights. I really hope that's what happened tonight. I was eating out with a friend after we had heard some really awesome things about The Spotted Pig. We sat down, ordered bar snacks and entrees, and waited and waited. After about twenty minutes the bar snacks arrived and were awesome. I could have eaten the chicken liver toast all night. That was the high point of the night. After another 45 minutes of waiting our waiter came by and assured us that our food was being plated at that moment, and it would be up in ""two minutes"". Fifteen minutes later it did come up. Sadly that was not the end of the problems. While the cider braised pork was very good but small, the polenta it was on was undercooked and very underseasoned. Not worth 28 dollars and definitely not worth the hour and a half wait. I was just very disappointed in the end. I really wanted to like The Spotted Pig, but I won't be coming back."
0,"Got the classic. Solid, but fell a bit short of the hype. Pros: - Excellent fresh baguette - warm, perfectly crunchy on the outside and light on the inside - The floss adds a really unique taste and texture - The pate was very fresh and generously applied, and wasn't gray or discolored at all Cons: - Barely any heat in the ""spicy"" version - Lack of vegetables. While more meat is usually never a bad thing, here the ratio seemed off, resulting in a heavier feel (the sandwich is also bigger than average, which contributes to this) - The spread pooled at the bottom of the sandwich, making the last bite of bread inedible. This may have been due to the way I held it, but was still an unpleasant surprise On the price issue, it's a fine deal for a sandwich of this quality/size in isolation, but weirdly going to a cleaner, air-conditioned establishment and paying more than usual seems against the fundamental banh mi experience (though not nearly as bad as the $15 designer banh mis popping up on restaurant menus these days). This is a quality banh mi if you're in the neighborhood, but not a destination place."
1,"once again, this place never disappoints when it comes to service but the food last night was just off. I went there on Friday, January 31 and my hubby finally got the lasagna that he wanted to try it and he said they nailed it. The lasagna that day was fantastic, tasted fresh and had chunks of mozzarella on it?! very good, tasty. However, last night the lasagna did not seemed as fresh and the cheese was barely there. He ate it because we went there just for that but it wasn't the same dish at all. I love this place, I love all of the staff in here, service is great so I just hope they can keep the quality of the food up. Now that we have two restaurants missing on Franklin, this spot will be busier but it is important to keep the food always great, that way we can always keep coming back for more. Cheers!"
1,"We went to Pure Thai a while ago, just getting to writting a review for this place. The food is really good!. The place is tiny tho, and we had to wait a bit, but the food is worth the wait. This place is such a great place to have noodle dish and they are all very tasty. Everyone should try it and it's not too expensive."
0,Best lasagna ever! Totally worth the money! There were just two of us and we split one lasagna and still had tons left.
0,"I love greek/mediterranean food but i have to say that this place is alright.  It definitely does not deserve 4 or 5 stars. Our food took forever to come out.  Getting the bill was like asking for gold. That took 15 minutes in itself.  It really shouldn't be that hard.  I know they're busy but still.   The food was good but not great.  Their portions were great, definitely enough to fulfill an hungry person.  I'll have to have some of their seafood next time and see what I think about them."
0,"Amazing food, gracious staff, by far the best restaurant in the neighborhood!"
0,"Same experience.  Got pushed to the bar this time, which was ok.  Service a little better and the chick went out of her way to say thanks for the tip on our way out.  Which I appreciate.  Food still on point, very good dishes.  Wine still warm."
1,"Bacon Mac & Cheese: the table next to us was eyeing it the entire time!! Belated birthday dinner date with a girl friend and she chose just the right place. They were accommodating to our needs. We changed our reservation a couple of times because we just could not leave an unfinished bottle of wine at my friend's place. When we finally got there, they still had our table nice and ready. We started with their water melon salad (which I do not see on the menu anymore). It was delicate, fresh and juicy and quite savory. We moved onto the bacon mac & cheese. Cheesy goodness of joy I tell you. Crispy bacon, sharp cheese, baked golden crust. My friend took home the left overs (we were just too full) and had it for breakfast and she said it was still good. Then onto the grilled filet mignon with overnight tomatoes, gorgonzola, and chimichurri. I wanted to try so many things like their seared ahi, pot of mussels...the list can go on, but the filet was a good choice. I'm not a big fan of gorgonzola but it went so well with the perfectly cooked steak, and the chimichurri (I would swim in a pool full of their chimichurri if one existed). I would've loved a nice chunk of filet rather than 3 medallions, but it worked out for us because we were sharing. The waitress recommended a great wine (yes, another bottle) . Oh yea, while the other table of gal pals were eyeing our mac & cheese, we were eyeing their milk and cookies...They caught us staring and offered but we refused though we both knew, and they knew that we wanted it... WHo refuses milk and cookies!"
0,Very good but too much overprice. There many other sushi around that are just as good or bettr but they don't cost so much.
1,"The chicken and waffles were great. The waffle was huge and filling. The waffle was sweet enough because of the red velvet that it didnt require syrup. The chicken was tasty. I ordered white meat and got two very small pieces. My date ordered the Blackened Salmon with yams and string beans. The plating was remarkable but it was not enough food for the price. The drinks are about 14 bucks. I ordered a mango mojito and it was somewhat watered down. With that being said it overall its an okay place but there are other places right next door with cheaper prices , larger portions sizes and happy hour until 9:30pm. #justsaying"
1,Very busy place with long lines but worth it!! The falafel and Greek salad were delicious ! It's just a small place so be patient!
0,authentic italian with good service and wine collection. recommend the dinner specials.
1,I crave their pad thai!
1,"When I think of Buttermilk, I imagine a cute country cottage, which is exactly how it feels like when you walk in.  My friends had warned me that there's always a bit of a wait for brunch here, so we decided to get here by 10am.  We thought we'd be the only ones there thinking ahead by getting there right when it opens, because seriously, who really eats brunch at 10am when alcohol isn't served until noon?!  To our surprise, there were already a couple of groups of people outside waiting.  Luckily, they promptly opened the door at 10am, and seated everyone accordingly.   We opted for an outdoor seat since it wasn't too hot out.  Unfortunately for one of the tables, since their table was against the wall of the restaurant, they were directly below the windows of the apartments upstairs.  I think someone might've poured water or something outside their window, which landed all over the table's food!  The people who were sitting there explained the situation to their server and he kindly moved their table, and I assume they also got new plates of food. I ordered the Eggs Huntington and although it looked tiny, it surprisingly filled me up.  This might also have to do with the fact that my friends and I ordered ANOTHER entree, in addition to our individual ones, to share.  This, might I add, was the best decision ever that day! We ordered the Pecan Pie French Toast.  Now I don't usually like sweets for breakfast, but this french toast was unlike any french toast I've ever had.  The inside did not taste like bread at all, but it had more of a creamy custardy cake consistency.  That consistency mixed with the bourbon molasses was the perfect mix.  I wish all french toast tasted like this!! Although I've only been here once, if there was one thing I could get again, it'd definitely be this!"
0,"What can I say?  It sucked. The ribs were burnt and dry.  The broccoli was cold and overcooked.  The sauerkraut was tasteless.  The half sour pickles weren't even a quarter sour.  The meat in general was only luke warm and seems to have been sitting out in the display case for a few hours before it was served. The only good things about Fette Sau were the beef brisket, the potato salad, and the beer. It's hip and the crowd looks cool - everyone's got a goatee, tattoos, or earrings.  But that's not a good enough reason for me to put up with bad food.   Might be a fun place to go for a beer after you eat dinner somewhere else."
1,"The best italian food ever. I would have given Tony's 5 stars however, the staff really believes they're actually in italy. It takes forever for them to bring your food. The food and drinks are amazing, I mean really good. I had seafood, the shrimp was gigantic and during another visit I had pasta and meatballs. OMG the sauce was amazing. I wanted to go in the kitchen and slap the chief. Actually I really do think the chief was from Italy and not mexico (no offense). I highly recommend this hidden gem. Take a date (or jump off) there, no one will find you and put your pic on Facebook at this hide away."
0,"Excellent pizza, insulting service. My party made the mistake of ordering dessert (a passable cannoli) after we had finished our pizza. What happens if you linger, for any reason, after they have arrogantly whisked your plates away is that you are immediately of no use to them as clients. Grimaldi's business model is: get them in, get them fed, get them out. So after about 2 minutes into our cannoli, our (Serbian?) waiter shoved new place settings and silverware in front of us as if the next party was already seated. Their tables are small so there isn't a whole lot of room to maneuver at this point. A minute later, he dropped our check in front of us. We were miffed but were intent on enjoying dessert. A minute after that he dropped 2 large menus in front of us. At this point there is no room whatsoever. We reluctantly gave him a credit card at this point but made it known to the manager that the service was a joke. I live here. I am used to rushed service but Grimaldi's is ridiculous."
0,"Heartburn, greasy, disgusting."
1,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I go to NYC 4-5 times per year and usually drop by for a meal.  The food is exactly!  I love the steak dish and potato side dish.  I tried the deer once, but it was too gamey for me.  It's hard to get a reservation, so I usually sit at the bar, which is fun because you get to watch the chef prepare all the dishes.  It's like watching Iron Chef in real-time."
0,"this restaurant is a gem and a work of love. Marc Forgione consistently deliver a great dining experience worth of the best restaurants in new york. this one is really one of my top in new york for the intimate rooms with a gentle buzz but not a funeral parlor. very knowledgeable waiters who can really talk their way out of my insidious questions, the food is a twist of American food and a more modern approach such as the hamachi tartar always exceptional, the lobster chili and the pecan dessert's voluptuous. too long for listing all my favorites, it is almost all the menu."
0,"Among the never-ending coffee shops and cafes in NYC, Alt sticks out in every way as the best. The coffee is delicious and worth every penny, the baristas are friendly and remember your name and preferences, the deserts are unique and there are a variety of gluten-free options, and the ambiance is what you dream a unique, artsy, boutique cafe would provide. This is hands down my favorite spot in NYC for coffee, and a gem worth making a daily trip for. For out-of-towners, buy the beans - I ship them to my parents regularly as they are now hooked and spoiled by it."
0,"Went on a weeknight, and the place was packed. We lucked out as a group witha  reservation had not shown up, so we got their table. Place has kind of an intimate vibe. Crowd was eclectic. Music wasn't loud (ie. could actually hear the person across the table) The wait staff was extremely helpful and courteous. As soon as we sat down, we were each individually given an in-house made bread roll 2 of us had the Buttermilk fried chicken (not going say much other than, TRY IT) 1 of us had the Lemon Pappardelle The chicken batter was rich tasting, and crunchy. The chicken itself was moist. The cornbread was moist, and salad was great. I think the entrees are a wee bit on the pricey side for what you get, not extremely overpriced, jus a wee bit, especially since the portions are pretty big. Right before leaving we were given individually wrapped homemade oatmeal choc chip cookies, which were yum yum. Not sure it's a place I'll be coming over and over. Don't want to break the bank. But all in all, a great first time dinner spot."
0,"This place is GREAT!!!! I was on a trip with my children's social group and we needed a place to eat. We were about 25 people and must I add starving after a fun filled day in the city. This place catered to us, like I've never seen. The staff was very helpful and helped the children build their salads and falafel sandwiches in a timely manner. They even came around and asked if the kids wanted more fries. The food is insanely delish!!!! I had a salad bowl with falafel and my husband had a gyro. The food is so fresh and so tasty I actually was sad when it was all gone. One of the moms even took a sandwich to go ..she wanted her husband to taste it! And most importantly the place is spotless! Not to mention the decor is very inviting. I am going back next week for sure and bringing my family with me. If you are ever in the city or live there, you must try this place you will be HOOKED! I am!"
1,"Slammin'! I was hungry but glad I didn't order more food. The broth is so rich and thick, along with the extra pork and mushrooms I got, it was truly a meal in its self. Noodles were perfect. What more could an Asian boy want? Definitely going back and taking family and friends."
0,Went for brunch! DeeeeLish! A must go! The fried chicken is amazing! Try the Corn Pudding! Also really good
0,"BXL Zoute is a great place to have lunch or dinner and I surely enjoyed a good belgian beer here. They have a wide selection of draft beer and good knowledge of each one which they happily share. They even stored my luggage during the day and gave me a good and fast lunch before heading to the airport. Service was excellent. When I'm back in NYC, I'll go back for sure, love it there!"
1,"My friend says to me, ""You have to try Amy Ruth's when you are in NY"". I said, ""ok"". I am in love. I- ATE- ALL- OF- IT. The honey battered deep fried chicken is to die for! Granted, it's a little on the sweet side. So, if you like salty chicken go for the regular chicken and waffles combo."
1,best pizza in BK!
1,"Pros: Excellent pizza. Is it worth $30 for a large pizza (which is really all they serve, along with a few salads), probably not, but hey, it's Soho. We were seated immediately. The host was very friendly. We were greeted quickly, and the service was good, although our pizza did take awhile to come out. Close to 30 minutes. So make sure you're not starving when you walk in. Con: In the year 2014, I find a ""cash-only"" policy for a restaurant this large, with an average bill of $40-60, to be utterly obnoxious. Even more so, when they push their own ATM, which they collect of fee on. Not sure if this is because they don't want to eat the tiny credit card transaction fee, or if they'd rather keep some of their income ""off the books."" With a restaurant that appears to do as brisk of a business as they do, I assume it's the latter."
0,"This was our second visit and we brought family with us. Good considering the portion sizes. food was good, chicken Marsala, baked ziti, and sausage and meatballs. Although the sausage  was a bit sweet for my taste, being from Chicago. One suggestion is that they need non skid strips on the stair down to the restrooms. I slid off the top stair and slid to the landing. Very dangerous."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by my most recent visit to Carmines...which I hadn't been to in about 10 years (although I remember liking it) and pretty much had written off as a tourist trap. We decided to dine here for my friend's bachelorette party. There was a group of 8 of us. Our waitress was awesome...funny and attentive. We ordered 2 pitchers of sangria (one red, one white).  I did not care for the red sangria. Of the ladies who tasted both types, the consensus was that the white was better. We started with the salad on special...a green salad with pears, apples, dried cranberries, gorgonzonla and a balsamic dressing. The salad was satisfying. I was not a fan of the amount of dressing on it, but it wasn't over the top. On the advice of the waitress, we ordered four entree dishes...which was way too much for our group. I would say we had almost half of the food left over. We ordered a chicken dish, salmon (which appeared to be prepared very nicely), penne alla vodka, and rigatoni with broccoli (in garlic and oil). The pastas were cooked well, not soggy, not too hard. The vodka sauce had a good flavor. The rigatoni was also decent. I did not try the meat or fish (since I am a vegetarian). To my surprise, with paying for the future bride, and including tax and tip, my part of the bill came to less than $50! That's amazing, in a world where these types of parties can cost you $100 for the dinner."
1,"The service could be better, but the food is very good."
1,"It was our last night in NYC, and we wanted to end our trip with awesome New York style pizza.  We were near Times Square after an evening Broadway show and had an early flight in the morning so we had to find one nearby. We stumbled upon Patzeria Pizza.  Boy were we glad we did. This place truly captures the essence of  good New York pizza.  We had the classic Pepperoni pizza and Pepperoni and Sausage pizza.  They were both so good the only words we muttered while we ate was, ""omg it's sooo good.""  Perfect crispy crust and perfect tomato sauce."
1,I love Las Ramblas. It's the only place I've ever been to that has sparkling strawberry sangria. It is fantastic and so are the tapas.
0,"So good! So economical! Great food, great sangria (I prefer the white), great location! Can get busy in the evening hours; sometimes there's a waiting line down the sidewalk. Only a testament to their quality. They have a happy hour in the afternoon and then late night. Open 24 hours!"
0,The place is small that's why I took off one star but the food is really GOOD! I don't mind waiting because of the happy hour! I sat near the end of the bar and enjoyed the view in the kitchen watching the chef in action! Their happy hour special oysters are the bomb!
1,"Great food, great staff. Even offered to take pics for me of my mom and I (it was Mother's Day)."
0,"Very over rated. I found the food to be a comic disaster of ""minute proportions"". We opted for the ten course tasting menu with pairing. Each course was smaller than the next. The first was a tiny cracker with a caper on the plate.  Even a single piece of sushi would have been 500% bigger than this pretentious insult that had no flavor and was thought to be a joke at first.   Degustation tries to serve food like single pieces of sushi at some of the trendy sushi places in New York City.  Yet the food is not as good, the portions are smaller than a single piece of sushi and the prices are much higher. Of all the pairings only two were right.  So the two of us left with a $300.00 bill. And then WE WENT OUT TO EAT. That's right!   We were starved.....  If you love to eat....  I mean FOOD!!!  You'll hate this place.   This is NOT Tapas for humans. Anyone who thinks this pretentious, unfriendly, overrated, overpriced place is GREAT....  needs to get a reality check."
1,"A family-owned joint that serves delish home cooked Filipino dishes. I love this place! So cute! So cozy! Very relaxed ambiance inside with such cute decors. The place is small, they probably have 5 tables inside. The waitress was very knowledgable and enthusiastic about their menu. She was attentive at all times and makes you feel at home. It's like dining at close relatives house. The menu listed was very limited compared to the other Filipino restaurants in the area but the food was really delicious! It features most of the classic Filipino dishes (caldereta, adobo, sinigang, laing etc.) Our orders took awhile to come out but the karaoke sure saved us from being bored. We ordered Dinuguan which was very good. Yum! The Crispy Pata was a while longer so we sang some more karaoke while we wait. All their portions are very generous. The prices are reasonable for such tasty dishes and good service. They have a Salu-Salo (kamayan) on the weekends which they talk highly about but needs a reservation if you ever plan to go. Cash only and BYOB! Awesome place! I would definitely come back!"
0,"Really good pizza. Neapolitan is not my style, but they did it well."
1,"I hated lamb.  Through the limited time I was served lamb, it was either seasoned poorly or cooked so well-done that the""gamey"" taste lingered on.  I guess since ""gamey"" lamb was what I experienced, this soured my impression on this delightful meat permanently. Notice I said ""hated"" with a D in the end. Yes, past tense, people. Whoa, didn't expect a grammar lesson now huh?  I'm a believer for second chances and Ililli (I swear, typing this name makes me triple check on the spelling), renewed my faith of lamb. Who's a born again Lamb-eater? Me, that's who. Whoa, am I preaching now? It's true. You will never see me ordering lamb. EVER.  But when I attended the dishcrawl event and tried a sample of their lamb ribs with heirloom tomatoes, I fell in love. Such a tease, with it's well seasoned fall off the bone, non-""gamey"", melts in your mouth, succulent, soft texture meat, with no strong after taste.  Yes, exactly.  Enticing flavors kept me wanting more. Our group of 4 ordered mainly appetizers to share amongst the group. We like ""tapa"" style/ family style sharing and the dishes do a good job. It's a good way to experience different dishes and what they offer.  Our waitress was awesome and gave us recommendations on what dishes were popular and those that were good for sharing.  We sampled about  8 mezzas (appetizers) and one main entree to share and we were beyond full.  Don't underestimate the appetizers because the sauces used are a bit heavy. Some dishes that stood out were: a) Black iron shrimp : well flavored with jalapeno, garlic and cilantro. It was juicy, spicy, and the sauce was a good dip for the pitas. b) tuna belly: AWESOME dish. Think Pork buns style but replace pork with tuna.  The tuna belly seriously melted in my mouth. c) duck shawrma: came out in a cone and resembled a crepe.  Mixed with duck and chicken over a grilled pita bread, this dish was really good. Not only was the duck juicy and well seasoned, the sauces of fig puree and garlic whip gave that combination of sweet and savory. d) lamb ribs:  the bigger portion of what I experienced as a sample in Dishcrawl.  Whatever I said earlier from my experiences at dishcrawl, magnify by 10.  Even though we shared the dish, I secretly wanted it all to myself. What has gotten over me? Me, fighting over lamb? So yes, this isn't your typical Mediterranean food cart. This is Mediterranean food,""suited-up.""  Flavors will entice you, ingredients are fresh, lamb is amazing.  Decor? Initially confusing with all the mirrors-felt like  I was in a mirror house but it grew one me. This place is definitely a place to bring a date or to impress some friends. The price isn't as bad for the quality of food we experience. With about 10 dishes and a pitcher of sangria, bill came up to be split 55 a person.  Not bad for a fully satisfying meal with good ambiance. For now, Ilili is my standard for lamb. Let's see what else the future holds to my lamb eating adventures."
0,"if you love japanese curry, then go go is the place to go go. alway looks dirty, but taste amazing."
0,"If you're ever in East Village, this is an awesome place to swing by. I'm a big potato nut, so if you're the same as me, try out the generously-portioned fries at Pommes Frites with a friend. The highlight of this place is the plethora of sauces that you can pick from the menu. You're welcome to try out a flavor since they have so many to choose from. My favorite is the sweet mango chutney, but my friend and I also had the honey mustard and the pomegranate teriyaki. Honey mustard tastes like what it sounds like. The pomegranate teriyaki was interesting, as you can definitely taste the teriyaki part. Not sure if I would choose it a second time, however. I wish they had something like this in the bay area, but I suppose it's good for my gut that they don't. :P"
1,"A friend recommended this ""latin diner"" type place to me, so what the hell, I tried it. I'm a fan, good food, nice service. It is technically ""latin based food,"" but actually has a wide variety of menu options for those who are uneasy to try unfamiliar foods. I tried the steak over rice & beans with side of salad & a plantane, it was pretty good (although not the best steak I ever had, but I still recommend it). We also got the wings as appetizers; coated in chipolte & chocolate sauce. The flavor was slightly there, but honestly tasted more like buffalo & chipolte.. maybe a hint of chocolate? but I might have been imaging it... The table next to me got the mac & cheese with pork belly and chicharron, that looked amazing, I wish we had gotten it! I couldn't drink that night, so I'm bummed I didn't get any of their cocktails, but I think I'll be going back & try some more. That being said, I'll be going back for more yummy food!"
1,"Came here the other night to get a bunch of appetizers, but instead ended up just getting entrees because hunger struck and all I could think about was order big and fast. I ordered the angry burger with Parmesan Truffle fries.  GF ordered sliders with sweet potato fries. Apparently if you check in on yelp you get an order of homemade chips.  Not sure if I was just starving or if they were really just that good.  After eating those homemade chips I was excited for what else was to come. As I waited for my burger I ordered a beer from a pretty nice list that they had. Our meals came out pretty quickly, I think I was 25-50% done with my beer.  My burger was pretty delicious, cooked medium as I wanted and had a nice kick to it. My gf enjoyed her sliders too, two buffalo chicken and 1 beef, her only complaint was too much blue cheese.  If you're not a fan of blue cheese, as I am not, just an FYI if you plan on ordering the buffalo chicken sliders or burgers.  The only issue were the fries, they looked great but were quite soggy.  I probably wouldn't get the fries here again, but the chips, I'm still thinking about them now... The service was attentive though they had this art class in the back, apparently they do it all the time.  Seems pretty cool and I wouldn't mind checking it out sometime.  The service only fell short when the art class was done and all of the staff had to assist the painters in wrapping up their paintings. To summarize - good beer, good service and good food(minus all fries)."
1,"Pretty clean, efficient restaurant. Yummy dumplings that are good (although there are better places in Chinatown in my opinion) and delicious beef noodles and sesame pancakes too."
0,"Well first off the restaurant received a C rating from the city for?  I will tell you for because of roaches in the bar areas and the kitchen.I don't know what happened to this Pio Pio but have they gone down hill so fast.The service is lousy food has gotten so bad the chicken very dry the salchipapa was the worst,hot dogs over cooked French fries under cooked seriously!!!!!!!   I am a steady customer that  well now used to go at least once a week sometimes twice and I always had a great experience,great food,great customer service.But my last visit was the worst the employees hanging around at the bar drinking hanging around with customers while I and other people had to wait so long for even something as simple as a  glass  of water. I guess the owner does not care about his business or the customers that make his business succeed.  This sounds like another greedy owner who just forgot about customer service that is why the restaurant received a C rating. Well. They have lost loyal customer I wil never ever eat in one of there restaurants ever again. I am so disappointed I warn people do not eat their the place has changed so drastically I couldn't believe it. Time to find a better Peruvian restaurant so Lin Pio Pio you are the worse and are representing Peruvian cuisine very bad."
0,"Halfway through dinner, the bartender/owner BLASTS Jimmy Hendrix's ""Voodoo Chile"" through the stereo speakers, followed by Nirvana, seguing loudly into Andrea Bocelli, then some too-loud stream-of-consciousness nonsense, then more ear-splitting Heavy Mental music, while inappropriately shouting commands to his wait-staff in this very tiny restaurant.  We, and most of the customers ask him politely to lower the music volume.  He doesn't.  At meal's end, he asks if we we're ok.  ""Good food & service, but the music is way too loud"" said I, a Rock/Pop & Classical musician for 40 years!  ""No one at the tables on either side of us enjoyed the meal with this overbearing volume.  Don't you care about your customers?""  ""Of course"", he says.  We plead, ""Then please turn the music down"".  ""That I won't do! If you don't like the music's volume, don't return!"" Bottom line; if you like being treated very badly, and paying alot of $, this place is for you. Otherwise, go ANYWHERE else."
0,"Always loved this place. With such a great ambiance, a sexy scene and great music. The food here is absolutely amazing, they just reinvented the menu and I didn't think it was possible to be better but its the best food I've had ever!!! The people are all so nice and treat you like family, the owner is so hospitable and his infectious laughter makes everyone in your party have a great night every time.  I've been there 3x this week and will continue to bring all my friends here for any occasion.. even just going there for the amazing margaritas is always fun. Super satisfied : )"
0,"Salinas is a great restaurant! The staff is extremely nice and helpful. The food is amazing and always fresh like the bacon wrapped quail which is my favorite! Not to mention the beautiful roses everywhere! Don't bother going anywhere else in the neighborhood. Although, if you don't have a reservation and its crowded don't expect to be seated right away. (This is obvious but apparently some of these 1 star reviewers below aren't so aware of how a high class restaurant works.) Management is wonderfully welcoming and always makes sure you are 100% satisfied. The menu is great and it gives you the option to try new things. You could literally close your eyes and point to a dish and be delighted by the fragrant  tastes of the food at Salinas."
0,Best square slice I've ever had.
0,"Hi in response to Lou P. Review I totally agree. I work on the same block and often work late. For lunch it's my spot for a quick fix but last night I saw a Kati roll truck doing deliveries and the employees smoking over the food bins. I watched them as they walked in and didn't wash their hands. They immediately started to prepare good for customers, very disgusting for such a popular spot. Beware if ashes in your food yuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I tried to speak to delivery guy to tell him that's really inappropriate behavior and told me to ""f"" off."
1,"I had a fantastic dinner here with my dad recently. He had the pork chop special and I had the fish of the day, striped bass. The pork chop was gigantic and everything was delicious. We finished off the meal with creme brûlée and a chocolate torte. I would highly recommend checking this place out. One note - they only take cash or Amex."
0,"After years of Starbucks dedication, a caffeinated epiphany has altered my coffee-drinking experience for as long as I wander the streets of midtown west. The Luna Cafe (121 w 29th) houses a strong brew, french-inspired pastries (authentic macaroons), and a trustworthy staff. this is no ""press a button coffee comes out"" type places: these guys do it right. plus the prices beat grumpy & stumps"
0,Still amazingly delicious.
0,5 dumplings for $1.. the fact that a grown man can eat a feast for 5$ is deserving of 4 stars.. the dumplings are just as good if not better than any other chinese spot selling them for 5$. sesame pancake is delicious also.. sometimes i do wonder how the hell they cost only a BUCK for 5 but i'm not sure i really wanna know. whenever im around chinatown im sure to pay this place a visit
1,"Decided to try this place out after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp. And anyone who knows me knows I can't eat somewhere unless I've checked Yelp beforehand. The family and I came here at around six on a Sunday and were seated promptly upstairs. What started as us having the whole second floor to ourselves turned into a bustling space as tables around us quickly filled up with people. We started off with two appetizers; Phyllo dough stuffed with feta and zucchini pancakes (their special that day). I was disappointed that the cheese-filled phyllo tasted something akin to mozzarella sticks, but the zucchini pancakes were simply divine. They also give you complimentary pita bread, which was warm and scrumptious. I'm now of the mindset that any proper restaurant should have some kind of bread as a starter. The entrees did not disappoint; Most of us ordered some form of kebabs (and by kebabs they mean thinly sliced, gyro-style). I ordered the Iskender Kebab, which is just kebab served over pita bread and topped with a delicious yogurt-tomato sauce. The dish was flavorful and the meat well-cooked. My dad gave his thumbs up on the swordfish kebab. Two others in our party ordered the Doner Kebab, which they liked but I personally felt that had I ordered it, I would have thought it a bit dry without the yogurt-tomato sauce. Our waitress was lovely and attentive, always making sure our water glasses weren't empty. What more could you ask for, really?"
1,"If there's one thing about hipsters, they know good food.  This place is it.  It's on a great corner with some outdoor benches while you wait.  My party had been there a little while so we were given some coffee.  When we put our name down I didn't get a good look inside and was a littler irritated with how long we had to wait, but it was Sunday and afternoon.  Finally when ushered to our table we realized just how tiny Cornerstone is and immediately were happy we found it and knew the food would be good.  I had a breakfast sandwich that tasted so fresh I swear I was transported to a farm in Maine eating at a big wooden kichen table listening to the chicken clucking outside and looking at the vegetable garden out the window that all went into making my sandwich.   The crepe my friend had was pretty standard. Overall nice prices, truely excellent clean fresh food.  Nice waitstaff.  Cool location.  Great for hipster watching."
0,"Worst restaurant manager by the name of Andrea Lucignani, who is more concerned about having power over customers rather than understanding. Although all three of us in our group were there a minute before his prescribed deadline, he gave away our table saying dismissively that a minute or two didn't make a difference (at least to him, not even wanting to hear that one of our friends came all the way from 93rd and Madison navigating through all the UN street closures). Earlier, two of us who were there before the reserved time, made an offer to sit and start ordering wine and appetizers since our friend was just a few blocks away but was stuck in traffic. We even offered to eat as fast as possible  to make room for another turnover. Andrea would not listen to any of it, snootily saying that it's the restaurants policy. Period. This is the kind of restaurant that makes you feel that they don't really need your patronage because they are so hip and busy. Although I've been here many times before, i'm never going back there and I'm telling all my friends and business associates not to. Unfortunately for them, my friends and I eat out a lot and we have a lot of friends who do too."
0,"The food was excellent. We were a large group and dined on probably the whole menu. Small plates for sharing! Not a bad choice in the bunch. The place is tiny! We went on a Thursday night and there was a singer and guitarist. Great ambiance. The wait staff was also really helpful, polite and efficient. It would be a great night out for a large group  (like we were) or dinner for two. My guess is make a reservation though."
1,"With over a thousand reviews, there is not much more I can say that someone hasn't say already. So I will leave you with this - BEST breakfast potatoes EVER with my benedict Jane!"
1,"I don't have that much experience in French cuisine, but I went here for dinner, and it was absolutely amazing. On a Tuesday night around 8:30 it was crowded, but we were seated very quickly. The wait staff were kind, quick, and attentive. Looking back on it we probably ordered way too much food, but every dish was fantastic. Starting with the spiced duck confit spread, it was both rich and savory. We also ordered the Camembert and Lambeth cheeses, both were very good. Next came the salted cod spread and ratatouille which were the best dishes of the evening. The cod was buttery and not overpowering, and spread well over the toast provided. The ratatouille was simply delicious. Though we were full at that point, we had one more dish, the braised pork belly over yellow beans. It was cooked perfectly, with a very crunchy skin and tender meat. The price for three people and a bottle of wine was a bit up there, but it was well worth it. I will definitely be coming back here again and again."
0,"Great dessert The apple pie ravioli with maple walnut Ice cream.  The :pasta' is made of very thinly sliced apples, stuffed with apple pie filling. The maple walnut ice cream is served on a great short bread. Very innovative. Loved it."
1,Had to wait outside in the cold to get in (in queue exactly as you would a club) but when we finally came in the atmosphere was club-like and chic. The truffle fries were AMAZING! They weren't stingy with the truffle salt at all. The meatloaf sandwich wasn't dry & you could really taste all the seasonings in it. The steak sandwich has this sauce that gave it a really good kick. The Cafeteria burger was decent but not the fav of all the ones we ordered. The country fried steak came in strips & were crispy. The mashed potatoes were ok but I enjoyed the greens. My friends LOVED the truffle mac from the mac samplers as well as the bacon mac (which had applewood smoked bacon). The service was really good and the waiters were pretty cute as well. ^_^ Definitely will go back if I'm back in the city.
0,"From the outside it doesnt look like much but when you walk in its actually quite a large restaurant. Since it was busy we decided to sit at the bar and eat as we were hungry. I could see the staff were very busy, but they did well to take our orders as the girls behind the bar were serving drinks and food! They needed a pay rise! The food was great here, i wanted to go back but we ended up at other places. I would recommend eating here. Simple but tasty food that is well priced."
1,"Have been here twice for brunch and loved it! The atmosphere here is great - but note * sit in the back room if you want to have a conversation. Maybe the front room suffers from bad acoustics + lots o' babies on a Sunday morning. Whateva - it is the Slope, after all. Everything else made up for our noisy experience when seated in the front: the food was great (Eggs Florentine - delish!), the Bloody Marys were spicy, and the staff was very friendly. Same experience when seated in the back room - but we could actually hear each other gush about the fabulousness."
1,"The space and service is a 4, the food is somewhere between a 3 and a 4. Recently went for a large party and they had great service and got us a large long table which was perfect. The lamb and scallops were really good.. but I didn't love the deserts. Maybe since it was a set menu..I'll have to come back and order off the regular menu."
0,"Curry here tastes delicious, and definitely worth the bang for your buck. Problem I had was the dish size was a little small for me but other than that, thumbs up!"
0,"Best margarita I've ever had: fresh lime juice, low sugar.  Tacos are all interesting and yummy.  I prefer the corn tortillas.  Not happy with the lines and waiting, but when 2 cooks have to serve 20 people, what can you expect?  The owners are cool, the prices are good! Go!"
0,"I travel all the time.  And anyone who knows me, knows I love pizza.  I have eaten pizza just about everywhere.  So when our limo driver on a recent trip to NY suggested Lombardi's, I had no idea what he meant by ""coal pizza."" I am also one who does not love a lot of cheese and I was actually asking the waitress for them to go light on the cheese like I saw in the picture on the wall.  She pointed to it and said that is how it always comes out.  I couldn't wait to try it! I ordered mine with extra sauce and romano cheese.  The others in my party tried pepperoni and a variety of other toppings.  We ordered 4 pies for a party of 7 and I am not kidding.  With myself loving pizza as much as I do, I knew not much of it would go to waste if it was good. We also ordered the bread sticks.  Now normally bread sticks are just bread sticks.  They are like just something to fill you up so you don't starve to death before your food arrives.  NOT THESE!  I am serious we had to order to more sides of sauce--we wanted to drink it!  That sauce is unbelievable.  You need to get an order of breadsticks to see for yourself.  The bread is awesome. We were happily enjoying our Amsel lights when our pizza arrived and engulfed our entire table.  One bite and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I am serious.  I think I shed tears! It was absolutely unbelievable.  Now I am going to have to make special trips just to go there because to think I may not be able to have this on a regular basis breaks my heart. If you are headed to NY...make this a must do! YUM!!!!!  :)"
1,"Just got back from a trip and landed at JFK. This place is a must stop if you are passing through the area. Old school Italian food, but they are at the top of the field. We started with baked clams that were sooo good. Then came out the linguine and clam sauce and the veal Don pepe, wow.. the veal Don pepe. Beautiful pounded veal, breaded, fried and topped with tomatoes and red onion. All family style so try to go with at least 4 people. Don't worry about drinks just order the house wine, white or red, their both fantastic. This is a MUST stop if you like italian food, even if your not going to JFK, make a special trip. It's that good!!"
1,"Very busy on a Saturday at 2pm and they still provided great service/ sat us quickly. The table next to us was a baby shower, definitely a good place for a group. We were 4 people and the shower had about 8-10 ladies. Good food."
0,"Love these late night spots since I hang out late and need me some mutchies. Nice little noodle spot in Chinatown near the manhattan bridge. I get the wonton noodle soup and the beef stew cubes with broad noodles. Price is cheap and food is great and opens late, can't beat that."
0,I hate food carts. Mamak is music to the palette. Best place to get impressive food from a cart. Very unpredictable. Recommend it!
1,Great artichoke pizza and crab pizza!!!!!!
0,"We visited this little gem while staying at the Trump Soho for the week.The service was top notch. Though they had a full bar and a great looking wine list, it had been a boozy night the night before so we stuck with Peronis. The menu is succinct and well curated - something I relish in a world of too many choices. The warm carrot & arugula salad was incredible. Peppery arugula with warm, sweet carrots and nutty pumpkin seeds - inspired. We both ordered pasta - both meaty, warm, with perfectly cooked al dente pasta.  After dinner our fantastic server brought out a plate of tiramisu - perfection. Lastly, the daintiest little vials of sambuca - a delightful way to end the evening."
0,Don't trust any other halal in Manhattan. This is the spot. Cleanest/most delicious street  food you'll find and the white sauce/hot sauce is to die for. You can't beat $6 for a plate that'll keep you full for hours.
0,"We always come here when we want to spoil ourselves.Very good food,nice environment.High Five...."
0,"Fantastic atmosphere.  Bring your own wine, enjoy some of the best pizza you will have anywhere.  Only toppings available for that day are whatever is fresh, and they make the pie right in front of you.  One of the best dining experiences in Brooklyn (once you figure out how to get a table)."
0,"Let me start by saying I've eaten here in the past, although I don't remember it being one the best experiences, this was by far the worst! The food was terrible and the service was not much better. I had the Africa Babatta(fried whiting 2 sides)of choice were backed Mac & cheese & Cabbage, The fish was dry and looked as if it were pre cooked and sitting under a heated lamp, the Mac & cheese was mushy with a glump of unmelted cheese and the cabbage was salty & bitter. I also order a side of potato salad, which to my surprise was one big potato!!! When I called the waitress over to ask that my mac & cheese be melted a little more; she replied with ""what you want me to put it in the microwave"" I asked for a different potato salad as it was clear that was not a salad, she huffed and walked away!! I thought the prices were reasonable until I actually tasted the food.  I would not reccomend this to a DOG as southern soul food cusine!!! ""Buyers Beware"""
0,"I've avoided going to Filipino restaurants since moving to NYC years ago, since the few experiences I had left me disappointed - the food is never as good as Lola's back home! But thanks to Grill 21, I don't have to worry anymore whenever a craving for homestyle food hits. Everything I've eaten there so far is delicious: lumpia shanghai pork adobo (huge portion-enough for sharing) chicken inisal pancit bihon sinigang halo halo special (I got this one with Ube ice cream. Halo-halo was great but the ice cream was a little too subtle on the Ube flavor. Will try this w/ Macopuno ice cream next time) Service is attentive and prompt, place is clean, and the owner Henry obviously puts a lot of care into running the restaurant. Also, they just opened a cute little bakery called ""Pan De Sal"" on the corner of 2nd Ave and 21st Street where they sell yummy pan de sal and other baked treats. Can't wait to go back and sample more dishes!"
1,"Closest to Spain/Donostia I've been in NYC, which is saying a lot from someone married to a Spanish husband from Galicia (we go there yearly). Came here for the first World Cup game for Spain vs Holland 2014, it was packed but the energy was awesome. People clearly love this place. Dry Basque cider (on tap!!!), exceptional and authentic pintxos, beautiful decor and especially love the open widow table looking over the park. Lovved the tortilla with pimentos de padron, tortilla boquerones, navajas and chiperones pintxos. Highly recommend!"
0,Cuban sandwich. tacos. roast pork. plantains. all good  but the best?? CORN.  wowza.  at one visit I think I had 5 corns and nothing else
1,"For fast food this cannot be topped. There's something special about what they do to the burgers. They are next level good. Everything else is on par. Service is what you would expect. Atmosphere, whatever. Get it to go and enjoy..."
1,"Yummy yummy yummy. totally worth the long wait for the food. i cant get a handle on what kind of place this it, its a bit country goodness, a bit mexican, a bit southern, a bit diner..not quite sure, but i really dont care because the food it good. very clever creations on the daily specials and there was even a celeb sighting involved, which is always fun. the one con--did not keep re-filling coffee, which might have earned that last star...."
0,"Amazing ramen. the wait is far too long, but it's worth it. get the spicy ramen soup with extra pork."
1,The food is great. Everything is really cheap. They accept debit cards when its under $10. Service is good. What else can you ask for?
1,"This place is awful! First of all, when we arrived, it looked very cheesy with all these postings on the window, you enter and it's so crammed an it's ghetto! the tables are dirty and dingy and the server was nice but we overheard staff complaining about the Awful managers, TMI- the food arrived quick so I was nervous thinking was this just sitting there or microwaved or something? My boyfriend is Columbian and he said this food was terrible! Save your money and time and check out Rocco's Tacos just a few minutes away!"
0,Order two days in the row. The banana Nutella crepes superb. But the coffee way too much milk .
0,"My husband and I have lived in the neighborhood for over 20 years and have seen every incarnation of this restaurant space that you can imagine. We were thoroughly surprised by this new venue name and promised to stop by when they were open. I went from incredulous to pleasantly surprised to awestruck in just a matter of forks full of the Scallops with Roasted Carrot Puree. After finishing that, I couldn't wait to taste something else and tried the Prince Edward Island Scallops. The ambiance was fresh and new, the food superb and the experience wonderful. Kudos, Salt & Fat, I'll be back!!!"
1,"In all of my reviews, the service provided by staff heavily outweigh enjoyment of food when it comes to those shiny stars.  This review is a perfect example of why I barely gave 2 stars. The decor was nice and rustic - dimly lit, the staff was nice (with the exception of *one-see below), and the food was well-balanced.  I went with a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  It was quite busy even for a Wednesday evening with even a few seated outside.  We all had our various entrees and apps, all of which were received well.  I, myself, had the fettuccine, which had zucchini and the likes tossed in olive oil and grilled shrimp.  Great presentation and nominal amount to get you just full.  The wait staff was very nice despite us taking a long time to gather the entire party and deciding what to order.  Glasses were always topped with water in ninja-like fashion, and extra consideration was taken when clearing the table. FYI.  they charge a 'cake fee.'  if you bring a cake/dessert of your own, they will charge you $2 per person in your party to have the cake on the table if you don't order dessert.  This was explained to analogize a corking fee in the event you bring your own wine to a dry restaurant.  I believe the fee can be justified if the waitstaff had actively cut and served the cake.  Was lighting the candle and handing out extra plates and spoons valid enough for the fee?  you be the judge. *The manager was very condescending when we had asked her about the cake fee and that when initially making the reservation and actively telling them we were bringing a cake, no cake fee was disclosed.   Instead of apologizing (even an insincere sorry), the manager replied with something to the likes of ' It's not worth the money to argue about the cake fee'.    If you're going to talk down on people, choose words wisely.  We did end up getting the fee taken off, but not before she figuratively spit in our faces. BOTTOM LINE:  NOT birthday cake friendly.  I won't go as long as that manager is still there.  She completely ruined my visit with her b demeanor.  I give it two stars, one for the food and the other for the waitstaff.  The other three stars have no business being anywhere near 1486 2nd Ave and that manager."
1,"The Breakfast Sandwich is our favorite. Also, the chutney is so tasty and a great gift. They are soft-boiled egg pros here. After we enjoy breakfast, we pick up a dozen eggs for the week."
0,3.5 stars. Pizza was pretty good. First time trying ny pizza. A bit pricey for pizza but was a good experience. Wait time to be seated was kind of long.
0,"You always need to consider the prices when rating. People give high marks to Per Se, but if you are spending $300 per, then duh!  It had better be a little better than  the local diner.  Anyway, Yerba Buena is very good, until you calculate the pricing into it. I love their cocktails;  they are very creative and the bartenders put on a show. The food is somewhat less creative, albeit reasonably tasty. Service is a bit too much in-your-face, however attentive. Maybe thats what I liked least. No, I liked the prices least. This place is too expensive!"
1,"ippudo is great!  definitely a treat to go...though i am not sure if it's worth the wait and money.  This place is definitely worth the hype...but to me, Ramen should be an inexpensive meal....."
1,"Great service, great food, great beers.   The burger menu is very impressive with 14 different types of burgers with traditional and unique topics which can be made with your choice from a wide selection of meats (e.g., beef, wild boar, elk, bison, ostrich, etc.) and bread (e.g., brioche, multi-grain, rice bun, etc.) allowing for numerous combinations of burgers to try.  Fries come with a basket of 4 dipping sauces (curry ketchup, chipotle mayo, bbq sauce, and horseradish mayo).  Service is very friendly and the atmosphere is a bit more relaxed compared to other rival burger joints in the city."
0,"9/10 for Atmosphere, 9/10 for Service, 15/20 for Food"
1,"I came here with friends two weeks ago. The pizza was good, but I wasn't overly impressed, and definitely expected more based on the reviews and prices. I ordered the Arugola, which was a bit soggy, and it seemed like they opened up a bag of arugula and dumped it on top of the pizza at the end.  I felt like I had arugula falling off my pizza while I was trying to eat it. The service was good, but rushed. I understand that they were trying to capitalize off the fact that it was a Saturday night by getting as many people in as possible, but we weren't at TGI Friday's, and that is certainly not how they should make their patrons feel. Overall, the food here is solid. You won't be disappointed but you won't be impressed, which is probably par for the course with pizza in a lot of cases. Given that pizza is a trend right now, I'd try a different place before I came back here."
0,"Was looking fo some good old fashioned breakfast, and we found it here at Juniors. Food was good and so was the service. It was so good we ended up coming back for desert that evening. The cheesecake was awesome and the portions were huge."
0,"The architecture and design of this place are impressive. It was bigger than I expected and a bit crowded and noisy (I had the sense it was more upscale and intimate than it is). That said, the service was crazy good and so was the food. The wine list could be improved. The homemade passion fruit ice cream was divine."
0,"For me, this is the best cheesecake in the world. Creamy, sweet and delicious, I especially like the small layer of cake on the bottom. I enjoy coming by Juniors takeout counter during the afternoon on my lunch break and grabbing a seat at the outdoor patio and having a moment to myself while enjoying their little slice of heaven. The patio is rarely crowded and quite enjoyable."
1,I hate to be a harsh critic but I honestly do know see what all the hype is about. I expected greatness from Grimaldi's and it certainly under delivered. I've honestly had better frozen pizza. Different strokes for different folks I guess. Cash only. I do not recommend going during lunch time during touristy months because the line is out the door and around the corner.
1,Small place with really good brunch! My mom and I enjoyed it last Saturday. The server was great. We will be back.
1,"The concept of brunch panini is so epically genius that it's almost too good to be true. The execution, though, was shockingly incredible. Everything from the delicious coffee bean aroma to the very attentive service and hysterically punned sandwich titles made the perfectly crafted panini even more enjoyable. I had the luxury of sampling various panini that were all made from the freshest cheeses, meats, vegetables, and eggs with wonderfully paired ingredients. The Filthy Sombrero panini, for example, is made with dulce de leche, granny smith apples, goat cheese and rosemary aioli -- while the Sir Oink's a Lot is made with a delicious sweet sausage, fontina cheese, basil pesto and scrambled eggs. They are even willing to substitute vegetarian items for meats in their panini to accommodate vegetarians. And, to top it all off -- they have peanut butter hot chocolate, nutella hot chocolate, and hot maple-flavored milk. I mean, hot damn, it really can't get any more Italian or any more fantastic."
1,"Tight space, made even tighter in cold weather (bulky coats and such) but worth being squooshed. Enjoyed the handmade noodles with pork, crab and vegetables. Light broth added just enough flavor. Too much cilantro. Chow-fun (flat rice noodle) spicy noodle special with shrimp, pork, and veggies was so big, even my clean-the-plate dining partner couldn't finish it. Worth the blustery walk!"
0,"Definitely get the knife peeled noodle. Had the beef knife peeled soup noodle. It was ok, not mind blowing. The texture of the noodle was good but some were too soggy, losing texture. I prefer the noodle texture at X'ian Famous Foods. Beef slices were very tasty. The broth was a-ok...a little on the watery side--i prefer a soup base with little more intensity. Also had the pan fried regular hand pulled noodle. It was more chewy than your usual noodle but other than that, it's not much to write home about. So I would definitely get the knife peeled noodle. Water is in styrofoam cups. i'm not sure if the food is good enough to offset the poor dining atmosphere...this is coming from someone not afraid of hole in the wall places if the food is impressive."
1,"Came here on a late sunday night. Me and a friend were very typsy and very hungry so we tried several items from the menu. She had the chicken wrap, I had the pulled pork sandwich, and we shared the calamari. The pulled pork sandwich was phenomenal! My friend really enjoyed her chicken wrap but the calamari was a bit too breaded; the marinara sauce was good though. Descent prices and service was very attentive."
1,"WHATT?! You haven't been here yet?! Well you Better consider dinner done and get over there ASAP! This place is soooo good. I have been an avid fan for the past 2 years. The atmosphere is small, cozy and colorful, but never overcrowded. I've felt as comfortable dining alone at the bar as with a group of friends and on a date. Its a Latin bistro with flavors from many different Latin countries- Colombia, Argentina, Peru.  They re mix of culinary styles and flavors can't be beat (MUST TRY THE PLATANOS RELLENOS - stuffed plantains). As for drinks, be careful- one bartender tends to have a heavy hand which I can only critique since I am a bartender myself and it can sometimes ruin a drink (mhmm, yea yea). Otherwise, the drinks are sooo delish. Try a caipirinha for a tasty mojito alternative. Think imma go this wknd actually.! :)"
0,I had wonderful food here! I have an annoying diet (I'm a vegan) and even though there were very few vegan options on the menu the chef came out and talked with me and came up with the most delicious mole in vegetables and for dessert I had fruit soaked in Mezcal! Also recommended for the appetizers is the El Diablito which is a tasting of six sauces with fresh homemade tortillas. The place is also cute and cozy (probably a good date spot) with various Mexican folk art on display. The staff are super sweet and personable.
1,"Ground zero of the current broth craze sweeping the nation, Brodo is definitely worth a stop if you want to see what this trendy bone-lust is all about. Both the chicken and hearth broths were great, with the hearth slightly better due to its complexity and intensity of flavor. To be honest though, the chicken broth here is really simple and delicious and clean, so if I were sick or just really cold and tired I might actually go with this one. Both broths were a really deep brown and actually have a pretty respectable amount of salt, fat and body. I think they roast the bones in an oven before steeping them in the water. The broth feels way more substantial when you are consuming it than you think it will. Like you can get legit full on a large cup of this stuff. Due to the fact that it is currently getting cold outside and this little window is in a high-traffic area, there's always a bit of a line. I got in a two person line here at 4:15 and when I left like maybe ten minutes later there were about 12 people behind me, so folks are definitely catching on. Tbh who knows how many health benefits are actually in broth as it is pretty much what you think it will be: salty tasty soup broth. But boy, is it some outstanding broth."
1,"Average food, excellent service. Lots of space inside the restaurant to park stroller or accommodate a big group. Interesting selection of infused vodkas."
1,"Meh, Honestly I thought for someone being on the Food Network Star the food would be beyond superb...I was highly disappointed as I made the trek over from the west side of Manhattan to try this. I got the 1)fish and chip - seriously there was a mountain of fries underneath the fish. They were oddly cooked and not crispy. The fish was not at all good, too dry, and it had the fishy smell/taste. 2) Foie gras donut - really...kinda gross. The outer donut part was great, but the filling just didn't fly with me. It was rather luke warm and didn't seem to go well with the fluffy donut.  I wouldn't pay money to eat that. All in all save your money...and eat somewhere else."
0,i love pizza.  the best anywhere.
1,"I am writing this as spicy chili mayo drips from my fingers onto the keyboard. Longing for a new lunchtime sandwich, I ventured a little further east than usual from my West Village office. Best decision I've made in a while. A sign above the take-out window states: ""No substitutions."" Trust them. The pulled pork sandwich is perfect as is. The sum of all its parts is really what makes this sandwich spectacular: the pork melts in your mouth, the vegetables crispy, the cilantro pungent and the mayo generously lathered onto two thick pieces of baguette. The bread is hard outside and soft inside, my favorite. Num Pang has renewed my search for a satisfying workday lunch. Minus one star for being overpriced: $7.50 is a bit steep for a sandwich."
1,"I live around the corner, so maybe I'm biased... but this place is the greatest! It's cozy (for being such a large/open space), the service is super fast and efficiently timed, and the ramen and snacks are delicious. I always get the same thing: Miso broth with a hard egg and veggies instead of meat. It's much richer than the 100% veggie option if you aren't a strict vegetarian. I highly advise it! For snacks, always the brussels. Consistently good and the same every time. The only bad thing is the wait time during NYC dinnertime and weekends, but to avoid that I advise going for an early dinner right after work or for a late lunch right before they close to prep for the dinner shift. If you go during these times (especially early in the week) you can always avoid a wait. It's also faster to be seated if you are just two people (since you can sit at the bar or a table). Once you are more than three, it's always a longer wait."
0,"My husband and I LOVE Palo Santo! We got married here in August and everything was perfect! We had the whole place to ourselves for our intimate wedding and the staff, led by Gonzalo, took such great care with everything for helping place decorations, to making sure each guest never had an empty plate or glass! The food was phenomenal as it always is and Gonzalo worked with us to put together a great menu to fit within our wedding budget. Also, I must give a shout out to Joyce Bake Shop for the most amazing (and beautiful) red velvet cake. Our guests have raved about the food, service and atmosphere! We couldn't be happier with how our special day turned out and will be back often for dinner and brunch!"
0,I went with friends to pio pio restaurant and i enjoyed it. The waiters re friendly and always asking if you need anything. Service is excellent but the food even better. The sangria was awesome. Their chicken was awesome.
1,"Bulgogi bahn mi and JoJu fries, that is all I will ever need in this lifetime. Run it all down with some Vietnamese Coffee. Can't wait to go back and try the pork belly and have another rack of fries. The restaurant was very clean, service was quick, the prices were fair AND it's close by. I no longer have to trek to Chinatown to get a bahn mi, I'm sold. Thank you JoJu."
0,"I've been a fan of Lincoln Station for a long time.  Excellent rotisserie chicken, meatball sandwich, and lamb chili.  The service, however, lately has tended to be a little inconsistent.  There should really be more than one person on the waitstaff, especially in the morning.  I've seen really slow lines there of 6 or 7 people and that can be difficult for one cashier to handle.  It makes me feel like my time isn't being respected.  These are the kinds of things customers notice and remember."
1,"When I picture in my mind what a little family owned Italian restaurant would be like, Benito One comes to mind.  It fits that image perfectly.  We stumbled upon it one evening and have been fans ever since.  It is our go to restaurant in little Italy.  Everything we have had there is excellent.  The management and staff are always friendly and helpful.  When we want a romantic evening for 2 it is the place, when we want a dinner with our friends it works just as well.  Not all of the restaurants along Little Italy are equal or the same.  This one is a gem and is well above the rest."
1,"My friend and I recently happened upon this place on Yelp and were pleasantly surprised to find a cute little brunch spot situated nearby on such a random block. Yes, there was a wait, and it can be annoying, but it seems like it's par for the course with decent brunch places in the city. So, we stuck it out. Once inside, the atmosphere is really quaint and inviting, and we both found the food to be excellent. Cheese Grits, Fried Green Tomatoes, Scrambled Eggs... All Delicious. That said, it pains me to have to give this place 3 stars, but we are both fans of good coffee and the coffee here was anything but. My friend ordered a regular cup of joe which honestly tasted like burnt roadside diner coffee. She sent it back and we both ordered lattes. The lattes were better, but they still paled in comparison to what many good brunch places are serving these days. I really want to go back, and maybe I still will, because those scrambled eggs are calling to me, but the thought of having a disappointing cup of coffee keeps me looking for other options."
0,"DONT GO THERE! We were 8 people at this restaurant at afternoon around 16:00 on 20/12/2014 soho NYC. This restaurant has an open kitchen which you can watch all the meals when they are cooking them and its really nice! we were sitting on the next table of the kitchen and we finished our meal. When we were waiting for the bill, they cooked their own bread in front of us and some of them are ready, warm, smelling great and looking delicious! I'm 3 months pregnant and i was craving of that bread. I asked the waiter to buy some of these breads but she said no, sorry they are for dinner menu and we have to wait till 17:30. I told her that its just a bread, i m pregnant and i really wanna to eat that bread soo much right now. I craved her... She asked her manager and they said no, again... Can you believe it? It was not a big thing for them! Do you know how  much is it a big upset if a pregnant woman crazy to eat something and cant have it!!!! The stuff is too ruthless and uncompromising!!! I will never go there again! Customers always should be more important than the rules of the restaurant. Because the customers brings you the money not the rules..."
0,"I'm from Texas, and we usually drive everywhere. I'm not sure if this is far for city standards, but I walked from SOHO to Cafe Habana just based on a recommendation from a friend and Yelp reviews. It was absolutely worth it! The sit down section of the restaurant was full at 3PM on a weekday. I ended up going to the takeout section. The takeout section had small tables, so I opted to eat there.  I ordered fried plantains and corn. The corn was so good that I forgot to clear my braces of any corn before attempting to talk to 2 Asian girls (I was trying to ask them for directions). I'm not sure if the girls were laughing at the corn stuck in my braces or because they didn't know English. The plantains were good too! The corn definitely beats the Mexican corn-in-a-cup that you find at corn-in-a-cup stands at Texas gas stations."
1,"After seeing this on a Chowdown Countdown on FN as having ""amazing cheesecake"".. had to try it (especially since it was literally right next to our hotel).  Sorry Food Network - raspberry cheesecake was O.K.  , And didn't have graham-cracker crumb crust.  Great pour on glass of wine.  Busy as heck. Tourist trap. Yelpers - You can do better."
1,"I invited my girl friends to a girl's night out however managed to make more friends then expected. After we ordered our food and drinks there was a huge roach on the wall. And yes, it can happen anywhere. We ran for our lives as only 4 women in their 20's can and were reseated. However, the wait staff could care less about the creature and didn't bother to attend to the situation. Moments later once our food has arrived there was another friend joining our party. Yes, yet again. We could not finish our food bad enough did not get compensated at all for anything and my advice from the attention or lack there of to cater to the problem- Stay away!!! Overall as it has not been my first time to the other locations; good food."
1,"The food was not bad, but I had serious issues with the service.  Our waitress was a bit pushy towards us but INCREDIBLY rude to the Japanese tourists at the table next to us.  She was being very obviously rude about them only ordering coffee and cake and trying to rush them out.  Furthermore,she took our menus away when bringing our drinks and we had to remind her that she hadn't asked us what we wanted to eat yet.  The other staff seemed far friendlier but this woman left a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be going back as a result.  That being said, i enjoyed the brisket hash. update:  the owner reached out to me and apologized for our experience.  Updating to 4 stars because it's obvious that the rest of the people here are not dicks, just the waitress I got stuck with."
1,"Excellent. We had the tofu seafood chijae, the seafood pancake and beef stew. The seafood pancake was very authentic with perfect texture. The stew came with some rice cakes and udon noodles in it. Very tasty. Service was fast and they even stirred the hot pot regularly before it was cooked. Tofu was homemade but chijae soup was a little watery than I am used to. Good Sunday option but beware- like all Korean BBQ places, you will smell of grease after."
0,"Way overpriced and way small portions.  An emblem of where the East Village is going.  Okay, I get the premise of haute cuisine: you pay a lot, get a little and then pretend that it was all worth it because of the scintillating neuro-gustatory experience one presumably has.  I have had those experiences at some very good and very expensive New York bistros.  I also get the influence that ""chef star power"" vis a vis television exposure has on one's palate, as I write about marketing for a living.  EG, I know that consumer perception shapes consumer experience.  And the food was good.  But I found myself leaving the place angry.  Let me be plain: even the more expensive restaurants I've patronized in traditionally expensive neighborhoods would balk at printing menus that call an appetizer an entre.  essentially, Graffiti serves little appetizer dishes as entrees, or ""dishes to be shared"".   Even by New York fashion-cuisine standards these were small appetizer dishes for around $15 each.  We spent over $100 on four such dishes and two $5 beers.    We passed a sign on 2nd avenue after we left to go get dinner: ""I can't afford to (heart) NY"". Amen."
0,"A truly special restaurant! With a menu that changes regularly but that is always delicious! My only complaint is the acoustics. The restaurant can get very loud when crowded, however, the tasty food overshadows the noise. Note: I highly recommend the lasagna. Its delicious."
1,"Been to many of the popular spots in this concrete jungle. And I still love Totto Ramen, but it was a bit of a trek from Battery Park where I was staying for this business trip so I was quite delighted to find this spot that was open at 3:30 in the afternoon.  I did not go with high expectations based on the sheer number of reviews and left soulfully fulfilled and satisfied. This place is truly a gem in a place well saturated with ramen houses.  As I mentioned in my tip, this place is now my #2 spot in the city followed by Minca. The spicy miso pork ramen was rich and flavorful.  It wasn't a bowl of industrially produced bowl of soup it definitely at soul and charm.  The heat was not overpowering, a warm and gentle heat.  The freshly made noodles were cooked to perfection. The eggs were just right with the yolk gooey but not runny. The chashu pork was a melt in your mouth perfection with a nice char.   Lastly, unlike the well covered ramen placed in the city this place did not have the long wait times and crowds.  Very friendly service."
1,"One Word, GREAT!!! Do not listen to the fools who don't like L&B. However you MUST! get the square... And the restaurant is no bueno... Ciao-"
0,"This is such a cute little lunch place - houses a couple of small and two community tables. Great lunch spot - tiny and very friendly. Your waiter will most likely be Australian. The clientele from all over. Their salads are really not too shabby - if you like your salad a bit hearty, go for the Avocado Chicken Salad: mixed greens, grilled chicken breast, avocado & boiled egg. For a lighter salad go for the Pear & Walnut: with chicken, fresh pear, walnuts & arugula. And I absolutely love their Fresh Basil Lemonade."
1,Delicious and healthy salads/sandwiches. LOVE the quinoa salad.
1,"This should actually be 3.5 stars. We went for the first time on Thursday evening. When we arrived, most of the tables were occupied, which was a good sign. We opted to sit at the chef's table. We ordered a Negroni and a My Little Huckleberry. Both cocktails were delicious . To start we had the escargots and the sous vide egg. Presentation of both dishes was beautiful. The escargots come with a yummy bright green broth that's tart and tangy; comes with very cool scallion chips. The sous vide egg is served on a bed of wonderfully crunchy potato hash, with Serrano ham and spinach puree. Both were scrumptious but something in one of the dishes made both our mouths and lips itch. Very weird, but that didn't stop us from cleaning our plates. (Lips were back to normal pretty much by the time we left.) To our surprise, the chef treated us to a mid-course of a mushroom puree with some cool, funky noodles and a mussel. Very good. He said we looked adventurous, so... Main dishes: skate cheeks and dry-aged sirloin. With the sirloin came the first ""miss"" of the evening. It was WAY over-salted. But my dining companion is a very good eater -- member of the clean-plate club -- and he didn't want to complain. I didn't really care for the sirloin, but we actually ate about two-thirds of it. So I didn't feel it was right to complain/comment on the saltiness. The skate cheeks were good all around. My partner didn't like the aggressive water glass refilling, complete with a ""Pardon my reach"" each time. Me? Shrug. How can ding them for keeping you hydrated? Neither of us was too keen on how our server brought the drinks menu back over and laid it next to me without comment after we'd finished our starters, with the presumption we'd be ordering a glass each to accompany our main courses. But I don't think this was huge deal, though. We didn't intend to order more alcohol. I know it's important for restaurants to sell it, but it's always the diner's prerogative to decline. We were pretty full after the main dishes and, truthfully, none of the desserts sounded all that compelling to us. All in all, I'd say I probably wouldn't rush to go back: for the price point, I was surprised that the sirloin was so disappointing. For the level of upscale-ness the place seems to exude, I'd expect the main courses to be spot on every time. But I would recommend Prospect for those amazing starters, even if you risk itchy lips."
1,"I have to give this place five stars ... even though: 1. The location's a fucking drag 2. The wait was an hour plus (Friday night without a reservation). I think we closed the place. The pizza was not my favorite of all time, not even in New York, but it was definitely like... the most authentic, I guess. It was really, really good though. The crust is really thin and they have a ton of fresh vegetables as toppings, was pretty solid. We also got a calzone for the whole table, which was great, it was basically a pizza turned in on itself. I've never had pizza experience like this in New York. Given the location, the owner definitely isn't just some bro out to make a buck, he really loves making pizza etc. The restaurant itself is really nice, not very big, dimly lit, smoking hot waitresses. I don't know if I'll make the trip again but it was a good experience. OH and it was cheap. Not what you'd expect at all."
1,"After years of procrastinating, one Sunday evening I just decided to go! It wasn't terribly far from my place and there was enough parking on the street. I was so surprised at the size of this place, you would never know it from the outside. There is outdoor seating too. We went on a very hot day so sitting out was not going to happen. In terms of food I ordered a number of things since I didn't know when I would be back. The crispy pork was nice and spicy but a bit on the hard side, I was hoping for it to be soft. The fish with the sweet chilly sauce was really good, I would get it again. The green curry is a must try. This will truly give you an indication of how good a thai place is. So all in all I would say I really liked this place but I found the food to be too seasoned. Extra everything, salt, garlic, spice, ginger etc. I have been to Thailand too many times to spot the difference right away. Sure it comes quite close, but now because of it's popularity, this place doesn't want to take and chances. Having said that, I don't know when I will make a 30 min trip again to have my next meal here."
1,"The place is eye-candy. Hardwood floors, candles, and exposed brick. The seating was worn out and torn, which I thought was a little odd since so much effort was put into everything else. I got there early and waited at the bar for my date. The bartender was friendly and attentive. The manager made it a point to tell me to get my bag off the back of my chair and hang it off a hook, which I thought was a little rude and off-putting, but whatever. It didn't ruin my night. My date arrived. We finished our drinks at the bar and were seated promptly. I know it's summer in the city, and some humidity and mugginess is to be expected, but we were absolutely sweltering in there. My date had to ask the waiter if they could crank up the A/C a little. It didn't help. While service is attentive, at times, it could use a little polishing. Our waiter was friendly enough, but I couldn't get over how dirty his clothes were. Food stains all over his white shirt and black apron. I could barely make out any of the specials he was listing because his unkempt look was so distracting. And I can't even begin to imagine why he was so dirty because we had two or three different bus boys bringing out our food and clearing dishes. See, here's the thing. It's attentive, but not very friendly. They were taking away platters we were still eating from. There wasn't much communication. They just sorta showed up and started clearing things away, while we're sitting there chewing. Then, the crumb scraper comes out and we're lifting up our glasses to get out of their way. Weird. The food itself was pricey and a little on the petite side. Granted, we ordered lightly because it was just so hot in there, our appetites started to dwindle. We had the oysters to start. They were divine and one of  the specials of the day. It was a great suggestion made by our waiter. My date ordered a crab roll and I ordered the spider roll, both off the specials. If you know your way around sushi and rolls, you'd expect these to be monster-sized, thick rolls. These were petite, but executed very well. Very tasty, perfectly balanced, and the perfect mouthful. I just found them to be priced a little high for the portion sizes were get getting (based on what we ordered.) It was a light dinner for us both, but we weren't offered a dessert menu, coffee, or after-dinner drinks. After our plates were cleared away (in record time), they just sort of let us sit there and stew in this unbearable heat. It was fine, since we were sort of engrossed in each other and our conversation. However, it took some time to flag down anyone in order to get our check. So, here's the deal: Food: Good, but expensive. Service: Not exactly rude, but unpolished. Not very warm or friendly. There are so many great restaurants along 5th Ave. I think I'd like to try out every single one of them before coming back to Blue Ribbon."
0,PRICE GOUGING IN HOBOKEN DURING SANDY- doubled their prices when every other restaurant in town was giving food away for free or reducing prices significantly....shame on you!!!!!
1,"Roberta's has a reputation for being a hipster hangout that is So Totally Brooklyn, but I think that's a woefully disparaging analysis. The food here is really, really good. Not only that, the ingredients all grown on the premises or sourced from local farms, and dairies. Most importantly, however, it's made with dedication, passion and dare I say love: for real, delicious food. I was lucky enough to spend a cold, snowy night here with some of my favorite people and that made the cozy vibe even better. There are multiple stoves and fireplaces that keep the place humming with warmth. The tables are pushed together into two long lines, so you're likely to be squished in tight between some strangers; some people might hate this forced intimacy, but I enjoyed it. Wine bottles of water are brought out immediately, which was much appreciated. We also enjoyed a bottle of fizzy pink kava from the extensive wine list and sampled a few of the local beers they have on draught (all amazing). The starters and mains are all outstanding. The meat plate was just piles of thinly-sliced, luscious local meats alongside a hunk of bread and olive oil. We also indulged in the incredible orecchiette with duck ragu, which was bursting with warm flavor, the crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside sweetbreads (not sure if they were the thymus or pancreas variety, but they were yummy) the most indulgent item on the table had to be the marrow bones, marrow being the fluid inside of bones that's truly unlike anything else on earth. Fatty, flavorful and insanely good. By the time the pizza's came, we were almost full but ready for the challenge. We tried the pesto artichoke pizza, the Lion Heart which featured pecorino cheese and Brussels sprouts and the Da Kine which was loaded with ricotta, pineapple, jalapenos and more. They were all great, and a pretty good value for their size. One pizza would easily feed two (not as gluttonous as us) people. I really, really enjoyed my experience at Roberta's and I look forward to going back. I must confess that my friend runs the show there, so we got an inside look at how and why the place evolved. Everything there was built with passion, from the glowing pizza oven to the rooftop greenhouse to the storage containers that has been transformed into a radio studio (heritageradionetwork.com) where foodies like Alice Waters have proffered some slow food wisdom."
1,"Very Very good. Tried the chicken liver bread...delicious. Some prociutto tart thing, a burger, and a grilled cheese sandwich. Basically, my buddy and I stuffed our faces. This is not a place where you want to do that. Everything is very very rich, so I suggest splitting stuff and tasting as much as you can because it is all very good. To be honest, I think the grilled cheese sandwich is what put it over the edge. It was super-rich...parmesan crusted bread or something.  The unsettled feeling that began to sink in while we were waiting for the bill really hampered the entire dining experience. Overall...it's a great place. Just don't be a moron and use some willpower...I apparently checked mine at the door...as usual."
1,"This is a compendium review because I have been dining at Balthazar since the soft opening in 1997. Its not just that Balthazar is so close to where I live that I can practically fall out of bed and into one of their banquettes....its that it provides a consistently excellent bistro menu. Lets start with breakfast.  It has evolved quite a bit from the beginning, when the offerings consisted of boiled eggs, oatmeal, fruit salad and pastries.  Now its full service including omelets,  Eggs Benedict (excellent choice); Full English Breakfast (tasty, traditional and enormous) and still my favorite from the very beginning:  soft boiled eggs with soldiers.  I love it that they give me my coffee in a bowl.  Still has lovely background classical music and a good place for friends or a meeting.  They have free newspapers to read if you are single:  NY Times, Figaro, Wall Street Journal.   Ok.  Lunch.  My absolute favorite for that is their moules frites (also available for dinner).  My husband (a hamburger aficionado) swears by their burger (yep, dinner, too).   The frites is (are?) a must...gotta be the best in the City.  Their frisee de lardons, too,  is the best I've had in NY.  The poached eggs are always perfect and the ratio of lardons, eggs, and sauce just perfect.   The roast lamb sandwich is also very good... and my vegetarian friends are happy happy happy with the roast eggplant sandwich. Dinner...well, I'm thrilled that they've put the cote de boeuf back on the menu...its for two and a bit pricey but sooo good and we always have enough left to take some home.   I love their specials...boullibaisse on Fridays, Short Ribs Saturdays...you cannot go wrong.   The grand-kids love the restaurant...the 7 year old orders the macaroni and cheese and the 10 year old loves the moules.  The tables are papered and crayons are provided... Can't not mention the little store next door...good pastries, take out meals, breads... Lastly, ladies and gents...  use the rest room...  a worthwhile experience that makes you feel, well, special..."
0,"My favorite pizza in NYC, which is saying a lot. Hopefully the son can keep running it when the old man passes away."
1,"Better than Sylvia's.  Yeup, I said it! I've been there a few times...and whoever i'm with it's either fried chicken and waffles and the afrika bambaata (fried whiting) with the following sides: mac & cheese cole slaw cheesey grits french fries I know, I should venture out...but I'm hooked on that shit. Big portions, tasty, not sloppy.  The venue fits alot of people so you won't wait more than 20 min (let's say that's worst case scenario with a big group on a Saturday night). Chill place - would recommend."
0,Decent lobster roll. Great soda. Too expensive though.
0,"This place went downhill fast ever since they changed owners and changed their name! It used to be called Istanbul before. They removed the lamb gyro/doner from their menu which is the only reason why I went there in the first place. Everything else is under cooked, even though I specifically say well done to them. Falafel is all mushed up and taste horrible. The bread is too hard. Stay away."
0,not the best soon dubu I've had in the States.
0,"Although it's been open a couple of years, I just recently went there for lunch during Restaurant Week.  It was wonderful!  Besides the utterly delicious food, the room is lovely, it's beautifully situated, and the service was excellent.  We were so delighted with our experience, that we went for brunch, and are going again for dinner."
0,"This is the best pizza in NYC.  We usually get sausage, mushroom, garlic, and extra cheese. It is delicious and the toppings are fresh. Make sure to get there by around 12:00. Otherwise you will be waiting a long time."
1,"Like Shakespeare, Mamoun's falafel is both amazing and overrated.  A great place for students."
0,This place is awesome. Loved the food and the helpful servers and the Israeli Beers.
1,We were hungry after seeing a Broadway musical. Walked to Becco for dinner. The food was excellent as was the service. Our waiter Jason helped make it a great night from start to finish.
1,"DROOLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS thats all i gotta say, i could literally live on this, its soooooooooo good and fresh and surprisingly not too expensive, about $2.8 a pop for a place thats from paris"
1,"This ramen definitely competes with the ramen powerhouses of NYC, but it falls short in critical areas.  The broth was SLIGHTLY better than Ippudo's, but not my favorite, but the rest is kind of ho hum.  The noodles were probably the weakest part of the ramen concoction, followed by the meat, which were not nearly as good as the other places I've been to. The biggest problem is the wait time and the spacing, and there's no real space to wait there for your spot, so you just kind of have to stand around waiting.  The spacing inside is very small, so you can't really take larger parties here if you wanted, my party of 5 had to split into two separate groups in order to get seating.  That knocks it down a bit, I'd only go over the other ramen places if I felt like I needed to give it another shot."
1,"My boyfriend and I love to try new restaurants and had read some reviews about Galli, so decided to try it out last Friday night.  The reviews don't do it justice. The moment you walk in you are greeted by a lovely hostess and great music. As we had arrived a few minutes early, we decided to have a drink at the bar.  The bartender was prompt in attending to us and got us some delicious drinks off their delicious house cocktail list.  Our table wasn't ready at the exact time of our reservation but the hostess informed us and the vibe of the place actually made it an enjoyable wait. We proceeded to our table in the back, almost like a secret candle light dinning room, where we were quickly greeted by our server. He was charming, engaging and quick to answer any questions we had. We started off with the riceballs which were delicious and quite a good portion! I was impressed with the great music, food and service. Hip hop and pasta? Nice. The servers are dressed casual and very friendly, very attentive without stalking our table. The decor is simple and fun, I strongly suggest sitting in the back room! Truly a gem in an area that is clustered with pretentious restaurants with awful service.  Will be returning with friends!"
0,"The ambiance and food at Mariella is divine!  Chef Herman is a culinary whiz and gracious host.  Portion & plate presentation is remarkable.  Service staff is attentive, courteous, and friendly.  Simply a delightful dining experience! Try the Mediterranean Salad--it's awesome, as well as the gnocchi and home-made ravioli.  The polenta that accompanies the succelent chicken entree is ever-so-tasty.  All in all, everything at Mariella is pleasing to the palate!  Try the Montepulciano red wine for a smooth drinking experience!  Desserts are yummy--chocolate cake and the blueberry panna cotta are my all time favorites! Come on down, one and all!"
1,"First time in this location - I've only ever gone to the one near Astor place. I'm deducting a star because the price keeps climbing up ($3 now). But the falafel is still delicious, the veggies fresh, and the hot sauce deadly. A little hole in the wall - pick up your food and go eat it at Washington Square Park!"
1,Affordable lunch specials on the weekdays in the newly developed LIC!
1,"Sat at the bar of this warm restaurant on a cold day in the Market. Lots of choices of cider (mulled; draft/bottled), which I love. Had the grilled cheese (tasty, but not amazing; warm, and not hot). Mistake of soup on plate instead of ""Harvest Salad"" (which I thought was a beet salad, but maybe I misread that). The soup (glad I didn't ""really"" order it) was a bit bland, but hearty (barley vegetable or some other grain).  Had a taste since it was there. The bartender brought another side salad in its place (but it wasn't beets- it was arugula (which I don't like) and cheese/apple.  I thought it was fresh, and fine (but I don't think it was what I'd ordered in the first place). The service was friendly!  The dining area was packed, which was why we'd eaten at the bar.   I'm not sure if my experience warrants another try.  It was fine, but I'm not dying to go back or anything, due to the above.  The bar was warm/comfortable!"
1,"Tasty and unique but not as great as I expected. I've had Spumoni Gardens bookmarked for some time and today presented me with the perfect opportunity to pay this place a visit and get a taste of the much talked about Square slice. About the pizza, it was pretty good. Its very saucy which is good thing because the sauce is the highlight of the slice. It has a distinctive sweet/tangy flavor that pretty much saves it from the downfall of not being cheesy at all. I know there was cheese on the slice but not much. Some slices had more cheese than others but even the cheesiest ones have very little cheese. The other thing I didn't like was the crust is kind of Doughy.  All in all it's still a good square pie but it defiantly wasn't this best in the borough, end all slice of pizza it's being made out to be. As far as the place goes I thought it was really cool, they have a large outdoor area to enjoy in the summertime (if your lucky to get a table with an umbrella). They even have a section of the restaurant that serves what appeared to be some delicious ice cream treats. I'd give the place a rating of 3.5, I'd come back if I was in the neighborhood and i'd enjoy the slice, but if I came here from another borough expecting greatness I would certainly be disappointed."
0,"Keep your expectations low for the food, and go for the atmosphere(if you are looking for a trendy Nolita spot).   Would recommend drinks and ordering at the bar to nibble on.   Tofu curry, lentil sald, pea soup, and mahi-mahi all mediocre at best."
1,Ok. So I went back for dinner a few weeks ago. It was pretty horrible. There was not a whole lot of people there but yet we still waited almost 45 minutes for our food. I kept seeing other people get there food before us and they were there after us. so WTF! I am convinced its some of the new people who started working there in the summer. They were hanging out joking around and not even concerned that people were not getting their food. This was happening to a couple of people around us too. When we finally got our food it wasn't even that great! I have been coming here for years but I was going during lunch. Perhaps they change the chef at night? I dont know. I just know i dont think ill be coming here at dinner any more. I will try it again for lunch but ill be skeptical. OH and another thing. I think i had MSG poisining! I went home and needed SO much water. Nothing quenched my thirst! and this lasted the whole weekend! I felt dizzy and queasy. I just dont want to experience this again. I am just really disappointed in this place since I loved it so much!
0,yes
1,"Sweet Baby Jesus, this cheesecake is amazing! I don't even like Cheesecake and I can't stop eating this stuff. Junior's is our first stop when we get to Manhattan, and our last stop before we leave.  We usually get a slice to go in the middle of our trip, too. The burgers, pot roast, and sandwiches are all nice and crazy affordable...especially considering they are in the high-rent theater district in Midtown. My fave is the Devil's food...although the Carrot Cake and New York Style are nice, too. The Devil's food is tall, and then covered in whipped cream with a raspberry sauce...IF you request it...definitely request it. I order these for all my clients, friends, diabetic mother and always for my husband's birthday. When you love it as much as I do be sure to buy their cookbook on Amazon or at the restaurant...their cakes literally taste as good at home as they do in NYC."
0,"Here is the thing: I have visited ""Champs"" twice. I think I've been to every vegan/veg restaurant in the city and I had high hopes for this Brooklyn spot. Both visits were midday, same server...a shakey, obvious transplant. The food is just plain blah, cheap ingredients were obvious. I'm usually understanding of non-seasoned waitresses, as I know that feeling, but this was outta contol. She was unable to quickly answer my simple ingredient questions, and it was clear that her priority was chit chatting with the other employee and laughing at a volume to break glass. This was both times! I didn't pay to eat seriously mediocre food in some wannabe hipsters living room. Get it together people. I'd love to be able to appreciate a vegan ""diner"", but I have a feeling the people giving good ratings dont know great veg food (Brooklanites! See what the city has to offer), or are just settling."
1,"This review is for the $55 lunch tasting menu (plus the $55 wine pairing).  Beautiful setting, very ornate.  Very good food with some exceptional items.  We loved the porcini flan, all the desserts, the salmon, and the bread (seriously amazing bread cart).  The big negative for us was the service.  I think they just had an off day, but for a Michelin star restaurant they were a bit of a mess.  Nothing awful, just nothing special and a few times waiting for things or being rushed into courses while others in the restroom.  One thing to note - if you are into wine, the pairing is great.  Interesting stuff that we never would have ordered."
1,"I'm always on the hunt for new Mexican places in NYC. I stumbled across Barrio Chino through various Yelp reviews and decided to check it out. This place is a total hole in the wall, I walked right by it, and if it weren't for the Cholula bottles on the tables, I never would have known it was a restaurant. It is small, but not overly tiny. There's a large table in the center and a few spots at the bar. I was there at 2:00 on a Thursday, so not exactly prime time. The tacos were pretty great, very tasty and I loved the choice of four salsas you get on the side in addition to the sweet delicious taco meat.  The tortillas are flippin' good as well. Thumbs up there. Now, it is a bit pricey. The tacos are pretty tiny and I feel like a beer could go for less than $7, but this is NYC, it's pretty much what you'd expect there, right? The server was good at the start, but seemed to get caught up chatting with her friends that were around as opposed to paying attention to tables. I was only there for a beer and some tacos, so I'm not going to hold that against the joint. Probably more of a 3.5 star experience, but the food was really good. I'll need to stop back for these enchiladas."
1,"Before a show next door at Bowery Ballroom, a few of us decided to get together at One Mile House. I had peeked at the menu on the website and was immediately impressed by the beer selection.   When you first enter, there is a bar to the left and another bar to the right.  There are also a few tables up front.  In the back is a more restaurant style area along with a patio outdoors.  There are three menus.  The tap list, the food menu, and the cocktail menu.  Some of us went with beer, others went with cocktails, everyone was happy.  The waitress was also knowledgeable of the beer selection and was able to give her advice, when asked.  The food is very tasty.  The Mexican flatbread had a nice kick to it and the homemade spinach dip was amazing.  The croquettes were good but not great.  They could have cranked the a/c up a bit but it was 100 degrees in NY so you can only blame them so much.  The bathroom was clean and large.  Service was fast except when it came to getting our bill.  Only $27 per person after drinks and food, which isn't bad at all.  Perfect place to drink and eat a bit before a show."
0,The artichoke dip is superb. The restaurant is clean and the staff is kind. I recommend this place. There menu is interesting and they are open all day which is convenient.
1,"I want to love this place - in the heart of Soho, cute, bohemian... but things have changed over the years. It is more crowded, the staff is less friendly and the foot tastes good, but feels heavy.  Couscous is the best dish, just plan to fast for 3 days after so you can fit back into your jeans.  Probably better for late afternoon espresso and people watching than for brunch/ dinner. Plus, cash only is ridiculous in this day and age."
0,"4.5 stars, but I feel almost guilty giving a street cart 5 stars. I've had this place drunk off my off, starving during dinner time, and casually for lunch so can definitely vouch the quality is the same each time. Chicken is consistently good, that white sauce is clutch, and the hot sauce is deadly. I always feel like crap after I eat this but it's soo worth it in a very sadistic way."
0,"I went here for branch last morning. What make me remember clearly and will definitely come back again is fish taco and ox tail. Try them, you will not regret for it!  The price is also acceptable, $19 for 2."
0,"Best prepared foods grocery in all of Brooklyn!  Super fresh and always delicious!  B introduced me to this fare at our first dinner party, and I've been loyal ever since.  Joe is the best! Joe 4eva!"
0,"sandwich military .. the best of manhattan, very good I'll be back for sure to try others"
1,"Great, fast, cheap and greasy.  Really enjoyed my meal, chicken fried rice and beef lo mein, but just know your getting some greasy Chinese food- doesn't mean it's not delicious though!"
1,"I'm pretty torn. The food was excellent, and my friends and I had a great time. However, the great time has little to do with the restaurant as we received such poor service. Five stars for the food. Absolutely. Five stars for Mark, who killed the COCKROACHES that were at our table. Yes, that is plural. A few other low points: 1) Our waitress, who overall was not attentive and generally pretty rude, lied to us about the cost of a ""comparably priced"" white bottle of wine, which was actually $13 more than we wanted to spend. 2) Although we had alerted our waitress days before and on the same day that one of our friends had a gluten allergy, we did not receive the dish without bread. Thus, the waitress offered to do the dish over without bread [as it was her/the restaurant's fault], but we were still charged $30 extra. This move alone is absolutely infuriating. 3) We confirmed twice that we did NOT order risotto, yet the risotto still made it to our table. (Luckily, this was taken off our bill, but come on! Listen to your customers!) 4) Overall, we were lied to about the heaviness and amount of food we had ordered. Our waitress told us to order two extra entrees that we ultimately did not need, by far. 5) Umm, yeah, and the cockroaches. Three of them. We noticed them as we were ending our meal, and Mark came to the rescue, even though he was not working our table. (Our waitress was nowhere to be found.) Because of the cockroach, we got free shots and one of our wine bottles was taken off our bill, but I think given that this restaurant has such a high reputation, this compensation does not cover the disappointing experience we had here. Taken all together, I have no other choice but not to recommend this restaurant."
0,"If I could eat here every day I would. The food is my favorite in Astoria and the service, whether it be in the restaurant or for delivery is awesome. Just writing this review makes me want Il Bambino NOW!"
0,"Mini, baby, minuscule tacos are 2 for $8. Go to any neighborhood Mexican restaurant in a non-LIC Queens neighborhood (just one example? Mariachi in Astoria) for some authentic tacos that won't leave you hungry for $2.50 at most. Enchiladas were decent, but $14 and no side of rice and beans? This place is for suckers who like to overpay for mediocre food with fancy-sounding names."
1,"I'm not sure what the hype about this place is all about to be honest with you. Is it cause they're BYOB?? Food was good, don't get me wrong, but there's definitely better in Hell's Kitchen. The servings were all adequately sized and fairly priced. The owner/waiter/dude did everything was super nice and almost makes me feel bad for only giving the three stars but alas, I must be honest. Place is small and cramped I thought and always full, so hard to just walk in. Not sure if they take reservations. I dont know. If I'm in the area, I'd probably go somewhere else but if you see an open table, go right on in! You won't be disappointed, you'll have a nice meal!"
0,Market fish Branzino is my go to. Great wine and beer options. Super friendly staff. Great vibe especially in the garden room. Love this place!
1,"A CULINARY GEM. Food is always a delightful surprise of yumminess. Plus, Charlie and Sharon are wonderful hosts. I always feel so taken care of by everyone there. Love it!!!"
1,"Well, it was Friday night and my friends and I came here because Caracas Arepa bar a few blocks down had an hour wait. We were seated immediately, and The arepas were delicious. We ordered a de Prenil and de Pabellon and the sauces and meats were juicy and cooked to perfection. For sides, wouldn't particularly recommend the yucca fries as they were eh, but the Tajadas (plantains) were really good --they put some sort of shredded salty white cheese on everything that is AMAZING and enhanced all the flavors. Also, the guava juice was fresh and tasted like it was just juiced. My other friend got a Pabellon Criollo, which was delicious, but him (being from LA) said it was just like Mexican food (beef, rice, and beans) except triple the price. This was my first time having arepas, and afterwards I am definitely a fan. The service here, however, was SO SLOW. We were all cranky and falling over our chairs because we were so hungry waiting for the food. When my plate didn't come yet, I had to ask the waiter how much longer, and it turns out he didn't even take down my order. We devoured the free bowl of banana chips and got even hungrier. i think the total wait time was about 40-60 mins for a non-busy night. For that unfortunately, minus one star."
0,"The place is mediocre. The service was as bad as it gets! The guy at the register yells at you to place your order, and wants you to get out of his face as soon as you pay. I have tasted a lot of falafel in my life, and this was the worst ever. It was a lettuce sandwich with less than four falafel balls. Didn't fill me up at all and ended up crossing the street to Chipotle to get a burrito. I truly have no idea why it is rated so high here."
1,"I feel like finding good pho is so difficult in the city so I didn't have high expectations coming here. I wasn't impressed or disappointed. Just like my 3 stars, it was A-OK. The broth is mild, they gave us a lot of noodles but it was missing the umph for me with the depth of the broth. The appetizers were good and the place is pretty cute. I say try it if your in the area."
1,"Despite its advertised appellation, ""Mediterranean Restaurant,"" ilili is a Lebanese establishment par excellence--and a very good one at that. During a recent visit for lunch, three friends and I ordered a large assortment of mezze, both cold and hot. The peak experience for me was the Bone Marrow dish, a platter of two 4-inch long veal shank bones (like the bones in osso buco, but cut lengthwise rather than horizontally), halved, grilled and presented with tabboulleh with dried cherries and tiny pita pillows. The other outstanding dish, a side dish in fact, was the garlic mousse - a lighter than air foamy preparation. Both Bone Marrow and Garlic Mousse could have been spread on good bread and enjoyed as such with a glass of arak. They were both heavenly. We shared Labne (nicely tart drained yogurt), Kibbeh Naya (out of this world steak tartare made of lamb), Kibbeh bi Liban (beautifully textured fried dumplings), Warak Enab Bil Zeit (good stuffed vine leaves, but not enough sautéed onions), Moujadara (lentils and rice with onion fritters, a bit too fussy), Tabboulleh (wonderfully verdant parsley salad, but not enough olive oil), Lahmajeen (nothing outstanding about those Middle Eastern meat pizzas), Mekanek (perfectly seasoned little lamb sausages), Lamb Makloubet (meltingly delicious) and Chicken Shish Taouk (very tender, indeed). The place is like a loft - extremely high ceilings and tastefully decorated. I recommend it with enthusiasm."
1,"I've been here multiple times. Some dishes are a hit or miss, but below are consistently winners: Roti Canai Curry Mee Ginger Duck Noodles Chicken rice (to die for) There is usually a wait, but it moves quickly. And the best thing is that after you order, the food comes quickly. Service is a bit above mediocre, but I wouldn't expect much. And it's very affordable. My biggest gripe is that its cash only. And the worst part, there are no ATMs nearby. So make sure you come with cash! Overall, I love this place and I'm a regular."
0,"Absolutely an A+ experience, from beginning to end,  for our daughters wedding reception on Saturday evening April 05, 2014.    The dinner was for 20 people and was held in the private downstairs room at Runner & Stone. All guests were able to choose an appetizer and an entree off of the regular restaurant menu.   (though the menu was thoughtfully printed with the names of the bride & groom on the front:)   Every single appetizer and entree were spectacularly delicious and gratifying.   A special thank you to our masterful waiter - who amazingly served us all simultaneously and with appropriate temperature food.   All of our guests were so pleased with their dinner.  Not thinking it could get any better - we were, once again,  blown away by the elegant & delectable ""baked on the premises"" wedding cake.    Truly, what a treat for everyone  - that cake was one-in-a-million scrumptious.   The above is no exaggeration and I haven't even mentioned how affordable it was. We would especially like to thank Alexandra, the assistant manager.  From our initial inquiry about having the wedding reception at Runner & Stone, through the planning stage, and finally being on-site to ensure the events success -- Alexandra was phenomenal.   She is a confident skilled professional who masterfully gave our family one of the best nights of our lives.   She is also a super pleasant charming host.   Yes, a gushing review and well deserved -- thank you Runner & Stone.   Sincerely, Patrick and Bill"
1,"Never fails. Quick service, polite staff, reasonable prices, and pretty legit bahn mi. Dat crusty bread tho. And the Thai iced coffee is really lovely. Summer rolls are very blah though- like taking a fist full of vermicelli to the face. But that bahn mi has never disappointed me."
1,"Great food, concise but well-selected wine menu, incredible atmosphere/decor. Highlight by far: amazing, friendly, and knowledgeable wait staff. They truly make the experience.  Highly recommended."
0,"My wife and I came in on a busy Friday night and were greeted by hostess, who was honest about the wait but promised that the food would make it well worth it.  Judging by the aromas in the dining room, we believed her and took a seat.  As we were served beverages as we waited and looked over the menu, time flew by and we were seated in less time than originally told.   The food was UNBELIEVABLE!  Homemade biscuits to start with sugar cane butter, country fried chicken with greens, short ribs on the bone and sweet potato cheesecake to end the experience.   The staff was friendly, drinks were on point and the jazz music provided great background music for what was one of our best dinners since moving to the Harlem Area last year.  We are so glad to have discovered this gem and we can't wait to come back and sample more off the menu!"
1,"I had the Leek Jardinera without cheese and the side of Tajadas, both were superb.  Having tried arepas for the first time in Colombia, these are pretty much on the spot."
0,Gaia embodies the spirit of Italy is her wonderful personality and her masterful cooking.  This is the closet I have found yet to replicating not only the flavor of Italy but it's beautiful spirit.  At Gaia's you can not only nourish your body but you can nourish your soul.
1,"A must go to on any trip to NYC.  All four people at my table thought it was one of the best brunches we have ever had.  The ricotta is really that good and worth being written up so many times.  The decor is also what sets this place apart from many other.  Such a good classic, yet sophisticated vibe."
1,"Believe the hype, this quaint little place is inexpensive and amazingly tasty, highly recommend!"
0,Two words Duck confit incredible and the grill chicken pail lard with frisee the best tomatoes not too ripe not to green. Really great feel good wine available that nice French bistro feel had a great time a bit far from home but it's worth it really love this place service was great waitress was friendly and gave a great wine recommendation I will def be going back to this place
0,It looks so good
1,"Simply amazing! Found this small but cozy French restaurant by accident. Me and my friends enjoyed the food and incredibly friendly staff so much that we booked  a table for my leaving party a few days after. The chef amazingly was able to arrange seats for us in this, obviously, very popular place. Try Kobe burger, mushroom risotto or spaghetti. Will melt in your mouth. Definitely the best restaurant in NYC, hands down!"
0,"This place has amazing tacos. The sopes are pretty good too. I think this food will appeal to those who know central Mexican food and those who do not. Excellent prices, too!"
1,"Went here on Saturday night with a friend who knows the owners/chef. score!  Sat at the bar and snacked on delicious olives drenched in oil and rosemary and lemon -- amazing. I seriously love love love the decor. It is super rustic with dim lighting and candles in lanterns all over the place. Very romantic but also good for a nice night with the ladies over several glasses of wines. You can sit outside, or inside at  a table, or by the bar in a long hightop (which is where we sat and I loved the more relaxed feel of that) Now the most important part - the food. Honestly, the only thing I can say is that every single bite was better than the next. Literally, I couldn't believe it just kept getting better. We had 3 apps, a salad, ravioli, and soft shell crab and the entrees were duck and chicken for two. Everything was cooked to perfection and out of this world. All the way down to the dessert (banana heaven something) and the little chocolote peanut butter treats at the end.  Drinks are great too -- I suggest theone involving cucumber and gin. oh and DO NOT forgot to get some bread and butter. Their special butter is mind blowing. Seriously, HEAVEN in  my mouth. I would go here every day if I could afford it."
0,"I love this place.  I love Il Passatore, so when I heard that they were opening a sister restaurant in Williamsburg, I knew I had to try it.   The owner is adorable. The place is adorable.  And I have loved every meal that I have eaten here."
1,"The crab toasts was delicious.  Akaushi cheeseburger was awesome too.  Shared the cookie platter and salted caramel sundae for dessert and enjoyed both.  The restaurant itself was gorgeous, a great vibe walking into a full restaurant and bar on a friday night around 9ish.  Very friendly group working here and I enjoyed the entire experience.  Not as pricey as you'd imagine."
1,"This quaint little spot located in the Chelsea Market is the perfect spot for an after work beverage/dinner. The service is fantastic, the drinks are creative and the food satisfying. I'm a fan of the crudite plate to start and any of their desserts to end. They have this amazing rosemary ice cream - it's the best!"
0,This place gets packed with a lot of guys. I had fun time here and some great memories. ;)
0,I've been to The Pines a few times and it's always been great. The food is outstanding and so creative. The staff are super friendly and nice and can answer any questions you have about the menus. The bar is a nice spot to sit and eat or get a drink. The atmosphere is chill and casual and the decor is perfectly Brooklyn. I love that you can see the kitchen. I would definitely recommend!
0,"Wow, so many reviews on here but it's so good that I need to praise the PIZZA! It's worth the wait online which usually runs 15-20 minutes. One slice was more then enough for my late night munchies."
1,"We came here on a friday for dinner and it was a really cute spot. The watermelon salad was very refeshing. I had the chicken and waffles, and though there was nothing wrong with it, it just was not how I usually like them. I'd like to come here again, as everything else was very good, but I wouldn't really get that again."
1,"I have been here 3 times and it's a great ""whole night"" out option for a date or group of friends. You will wait . An hour. Or maybe two. If you go into the night with that attitude and imbibe on some wine or a cheese plate and make the most of your wait with good conversation when you finally sit and get to eat your delicious pizza you will have already had a great night ! In the winter months, I love the 70s ski-lodge vibe they have going on in the back, with a string-lighted tent and a huge vat of spiked cider to pass the time! I have tried some of the other dishes here, including the veal sweat breads (I went with a friend who is a chef and trust me she did not tell me what sweat breads were before I tried them!) also a blue crab pasta dish, both were good, a little adventurous for my taste, and I think this is the place to maybe share a dish but def come for the pizza! The menu changes but they had a ""cherry poppin pizza"" on the menu that used to be my fav. Can't really go wrong with the combos they put together. The seating is long lunch table style so a party of two can feel a little disjointed but come with a group and it's a lot of fun!"
0,"I wish yelp would allow me to give negative stars because that was my experience at this establishment. I ordered a burger medium rare and it came well over cooked. I politely sent the burger back. After waiting for the burger to return it came back on the same bun I had with the original. After seeing my teeth marks along with cold soggy fries I was furious. The waitress was a turd. I wouldn't recommend the place to anyone. I have experienced better from a real cafeteria, and I now know why cafeteria has it's name."
0,This place I know since it was a little hole in the wall that I used to flock to from Manhattan like a ritual every week. The food is better than I have had in many places in Thailand. The heat can be dialed up - sometimes you do need to speak firmly to the staff to do so as they do not believe you can eat things that hot :-) There are a few special dishes you will not find better anywhere. I think today I would share with you my suggestion of the Massaman with Beef. few know but this dish is cooked for 48 hours before it ever reaches your plate. All the complex flavors mold together and create a dance over your taste buds. I have this dish all over Thailand and this is better. I love bringing friends here but I do so with the caution that they will be ruined. Once you eat here having properly ordered off the menu. No Thai place in NYC will ever live up to this standard. My suggestions.. get there early- or avoid dinner rush. People congregate outside and have to wait sometimes an hour to get in. I used to grab a drink at the bar on the corner to kill some time
1,"Took over 1 hour to deliver a sandwich and fries 8 blocks away. Delivery guy was extremely rude on the phone when he called to let me know he was in the lobby. Needless to say, the food was cold including the fries which were cold and soggy by the time they arrived. What kind of company in the food industry operates this way???"
0,Best jerk chicken and big portions. Delivery was pretty quick.
1,"Not only have I had an almond croissant, but I was lucky enough to be in the area on a Sunday afternoon with a craving for brunch. For $10 I ordered the Avocado Bacon Benedict, which comes with a delicious arugula salad. The Benedict was absolutely delicious - poached egg, bacon, and hollandaise on top of mashed avocado! What genius thought of that?"
1,"This place was alright. I am a Jewish and so it was ashame to find out that all the meatballs other than vegetarian contained pork. However, I still felt things were a little overpriced and the seating is quite cramped. At night waits appear to be a minimum 30 minutes. I had 4 meatballs, a small risotto, and a toddy (warm wine basically) - came to 18.50, I was still quite hungry with an empty wallet. The service is great,, very friendly people, tried to explain the menu etc. I guess technically this place is unique, and wortha try in that manner, I will update this if/when I find a better meatball place. Pros Good meatballs, sandwhiches seemed good, very friendly people, nice atmosphere Cons pricey, wait times (even 2 hours on a sat night), not for kosher jews Keep in mind, if this place is full, noodle bar IS AN AMAZING place which is 2 secs away, go there (read my review on that)."
0,"Good for date night.  Great wine.  Truffle risotto was good as would anything with 70g of shaved truffles would be.   Commonly with fine dining, the atmosphere is overly-refined and the crowd is older.  Our truffle shaving expert was nice and chatted with us without making us feel as though he was putting on the song and dance."
0,"I went there recently and I have to say this is a great place if you're looking for Penang style hawker/street food. It is very authentic and the food come very close to what you would get in Malaysia especially in Penang Island. Even the waitress is from there. I can't speak for other ""types"" of dishes since my goal was to get those exact food I mentioned above and for that I was very satisfy with it."
1,"I went with group of 12. Our reservation was at 9:00pm but we got seated after an hour. They served us complimentary calamari and cheese to apologize for the delay which was nice, but the service was quite slow. We all had the three pasta on the menu and it was around 11 pm that we actually got to have the pasta. They were pretty slow in re-filling our food as well.. And the food was not that great. I only liked the arrabiata with shrimp. The other one tasted only of broccoli and the ravioli did not have any flavor."
1,"AMBIANCE:  Cute, brick exposed place.  Went on a nice summer night and all the walls were down facing the street and there were several tables outdoors.  Nice breeze.  The menus are handwritten just to add to the appeal.  To note, this place is like the one crowded restaurant on the street--for good reason!!  Of the patrons, I noticed quite a lot of male on male meals.  They know where the good stuff is. SERVICE:  Great.  Constant water checks, prompt service.  They let you sit and relax and do not rush you out the door like many NY places.  We had an 830 reservation for 5 which was immediately honored upon our arrival even though it was quite crowded inside. FOOD: In order of favorites --FREE DELICIOUS FOCCACIA BREAD W OLIVE OIL AND VINEGAR...save some to dip in the sauces of the pastas! --Calamari ($9): grilled calamari over a bed of arugula.  Note that this is grilled calamari and not breaded/fried.  It was quite a hit with my family..especially since the flavors spread onto the arugula as well. 1.  Spinach gnocchi ($14): HOMEMADE w gorgonzola sauce;  EVERYONE knows to order this and it did not disappoint!  We had 2 orders!  Super creamy,  the size of the dish was quite large, especially considering that is is too rich to finish alone (but sharing is caring!).  The gnocchis were sooo soft and DO melt in your mouth.  If compared to Uva..Uva's gnocchi had a distinct truffle taste...comparable softness of gnocchi but completely different flavor...this was more like what I would describe as a thick alfredoish sauce (Butter, half n half, thick cream, you get the idea).  Both delicious.   2.  Tarliatelle al ragu ($13): HOMEMADE w tomato sauce and ground beef;  MMMMMM this was MEATY and RICH!  I ordered this for my dad and he ate it all..if you like meat then get this!! 3.  Spaghetti alla chitarra ($13): HOMEMADE with fresh chopped tomato, basil, tomato; rich in flavor, also had chunks of mozzarella.  Quite tasty. 4.   Special of the day: pasta with tomatoes, asparagus, and shrimp;  oh man...I ordered this for my mom and lucky me I got to eat all her PRAWNS (huge huge huge) because she has high cholesterol.  I would say this dish had the least amount of flavor but made up for it in PRAWNS.   PRICES: Cash onlyl!  What you pay is totally worth it..and the prices are not bad at all.  The pasta's were all from $11-14.  Lambchops were the highest price of $27.  Second highest is the Sirloin steak $25.  The fish of the day is market price.   ***For 5 pastas, 1 appetizer and 3 Peronis, the bill was LESS THAN $100.   I chose this place for my Dad's 51st birthday dinner and it was a success.  My family enjoyed their meal and everyone was happy and full and I did not go broke when handed the bill.  5 stars."
0,"We recently had an opportunity to stop by La Sirene for dinner. Our friends have been raving about this place for so long and when we visited NYC this is where, they told us, we NEEDED to go and they were so right. We were greeted by the hostess and told her that it was our first time visiting and that we had made a reservation and she was happy to seat us right away. ""The waitresses here are the nicest"" whispered my friend. She also happily offered to take our coats. She later on told us they put the coats downstairs, so everyone can seat comfortably and no one steps on your jacket , which I thought was really sweet. The BYOB concept is also great as our friend likes to enjoy his very eclectic collection of wine with good friends once in a while and what better way to do it than in a cozy place with great food and an even better atmosphere.For the appetizer we had the pate which was a nicely sized pate with a little salad. It tasted as a good pate should, very rich with a good mix of flavors. And, as could be expected, all of this paired nicely with a glass of red wine. As my main course I had the hanger steak and it was FANTASTIC. The steak was presented thinly sliced and had an incredible aroma and taste to it. I could eat this steak dish every day. My friend ordered the dessert for us and out came the most interesting dessert I've seen in a long time. Ex explained that those were Profiterolles and they were a house specialty. Our server, a pretty young woman with interesting tattoos,was good, and seemed to enjoy her work, which makes all of the difference between great service and acceptable service. Plates were cleared promptly, glasses were refilled without asking, and an offer for a second basket of bread was gladly accepted after we had finished the first. I wish I had remembered her name. Overall, each of the employees that we met were really good at making eye contact, and seemed content in their tasks.What a great experience! Thank you, La Sirene"
1,"came here for restaurant week, expecting limited selection and portions..boy don't come with expectations.  The menu has a slew of options with generous portions, giving the first-time patron a close examination of gourmet Lebanese.  The ambiance is incredible, too.  Definitely a place to take a date."
0,Going to keep this short and sweet.  I love this place.  The drinks from the bar are not watered down and the food is good.  Just not a visit to NYC if I don't get at least one meal there per visit.
0,"I'm a southern girl with a weakness for the comfort food. Pies N Thighs hit the spot, though I have to say I could have done without the long wait and attitude. I heard the Gibson is dishing out pulled pork sandwiches that rock on Fridays for happy hour. BBQ is suppose to be cheap and unfashionable."
0,"I had their katsu curry. It's pretty good, This is a good place to stop by for a quick bite to eat. Seems very popular among the staff who work in offices in & around the area. Lunch time was quite busy."
1,Food was amazing. Loved turkey dinner and pancakes and chicken. Not the best seating-very small and crowded. Have not stopped talking about the restaurant since.
0,"very important what kind of pizza, you will an order! but BEST PIZZA in the world so far. It's very good more than in Italy;)"
0,Our kids love this place. They drink the syrup like it's hot chocolate! The wait is rather long but it's so worth it!
0,"Quaint little spot near South Street Seaport. I came here with a few coworkers after work. I ordered a cup of tea for about $1.50. It was a very cosy and small place to simply unwind after a hard days work. My coworkers ordered beer and scotch and they enjoyed their drinks. The staff was pleasant but we were the only people in the place at the time. It is great if you are in the area and looking for a quiet, place to grab a drink and have a chat with some friends."
0,"Excellent food served with a smile! :) Only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because how small the place is, but overall it's a great place!"
0,"Finally, a different kind of Spanish restaurant! Unlike other Spanish restaurants that repeat the same old cliches, Salinas has several tapas and main dishes drawn from the food from the Balearic Islands. I've eaten at Salinas three times and every time I went, the food was impressively consistent and the place reminds me of a resort on Majorca Island in Spain. By the way, the picture doesn't do justice since it doesn't show the beautiful garden with a fireplace. If I want to impress anyone from foodie friends to colleagues or go on a date, I'd take them to Salinas without a doubt. ""Crujiente""  and ""coles and coliflor"" are ones that I'd recommend for those who aren't familiar with the Balearic cuisine. Also, try ""torrija"" for dessert - it'll please all your senses."
1,"I haven't been to Yuca bar in over a year since last Tuesday. After finishing our happy hour shenanigans there, I kept asking myself why it took me so long to visit again. Oh how I've missed their incredibly delicious mojitos. The minty, limey freshness with a stick of sugarcane.. Hands down my favorite spot for mojitos. We waited around an hour at the bar for a table.. Not too shabby considering the place was jam filled with patrons for their half off happy hour deal. Definitely come with at least 4 people so you can try a variety of tapas on their menu. We ordered 7 different ones between the 5 of us and it was a perfect amount. Some of my favorites are the coconut shrimp, the empanadas mixtos and the fish croquettes!"
0,"Everything is fantastic about this place, very low lights, flowers everywhere, great menu and wines, great service. One of the smoothest spot in the city. Highly recommended."
0,I just moved to the area from Wburg north... Which makes it seem like I moved from Kansas.  I live right around the corner from Moto and it's already taken hold of my heart.  I love everything about it from its guest capacity to its date cake. Everything about this place is spot on.
1,"Have you been living your entire life eating just one type of meatball? That's not living, that's sleepwalking. To say I went balls deep this week at The Meatball Shop is an understatement.  I tried each meatball in every different way it could be served - naked meatballs, sauced meatballs, meatballs pressed on buns, meatballs on the side, and meatballs on a hero. The Verdict: Deliciousness My favorite was the chicken meatballs with Parmesan Creme over the Risotto but everything tasted good.  Beers are $4 and you can build your own Ice Cream sandwich for dessert. This place is great for a laid back meal.  They serve till 4 a.m. (for your prehangover convenience), so sit down, grab a felt-tip pen, and mark your order on these wipe-away laminated sheets.  I'm balls out for this one."
1,"Blessed assurance! Halal Guys is mine! Oh what a foretaste of glory divine! The gospel truth is here. Sometimes there is no line. There's little I can say that hasn't already been said about the guys. They're just great. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert. I'm not even kidding. Sometimes, I go a little too heavy on the red sauce. Take it from me, you want no part of that unless you have a quart of milk close at hand. In other words Halal Guys is church. And I am a forever worshipper."
0,"i have been going to Natureworks since they first openes and I've always enjoyed the service and their food. Almost everyone who I work with that goes to the gym eats here.  The evas omelete starts off my day full of energy and I end it with a high protein vegetarian salad with a side of  my favorite sauce tahini! I will continue to order from this place, I'm always completely satisfied with everything."
1,"I now have a reason to visit Sunnyside more often. I had a GREAT OVERALL EXPERIENCE here. The restaurant is a bit SMALL but it's very COZY and INTIMATE. It would be a perfect place for a date night. DECOR is very BRIGHT RUSTIC but with a SLIGHT EDGE and it doesn't scream hipster. SERVICE was EXCELLENT, courses were appropriately served time-wise, and they didn't rush us out even though we've been sitting for almost 3 hours. **The MENU here is so VARIETAL and everything sounds so good! I love how there are SO MANY OPTIONS in each category (esp different type of meats). Another plus is that their menu is VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY! DE MOLE NACHOS--REALLY SOLID nachos! Everything tasted super FRESH (ESP the chips) including the GUACAMOLE. Loved that their BEANS were WARM and their CHEESE GOOEY...this was a perfect pairing with the guac. They do give you a BASKET OF CHIPS and TANGY SAUCE to start but I would still recommend getting the nachos! POLLO CON MOLE POBLANO (PLATO PRINICIPALE)--Man, what can I say about that MOLE SAUCE?! It's something I've never had and I was BLOWN AWAY. It's TANGY, SWEET, SALTY, and sorta INDESCRIBABLE unless you try it yourself. The PORTION size was HUGE; I would probably SHARE this with another person next time. The chicken was a thigh and a drumstick together and the meat was FALL-OFF-THE-BONE TENDER. Staple beans and rice were great as well. My friend ordered a SPINACH QUESADILLA and it was STUFFED and NOT FLAT at all! I loved how they served it (cut into wedges and each piece leaned on another). I definitely will be coming back!! FYI CHEAP CHEAP FYI COME ON A WEEKNIGHT"
1,"I made reservations here last night just based on some of the positive reviews here.  It was our first anniversary, so I was looking for a place with a nice atmosphere, great food, and not over-priced.  And all I could say is WOW.  It's not a big place, it's very intimate, great for a date.  The service was top-notch - Aileen was an absolute sweetheart, and very helpful with questions, despite her broken english.   And then we ate.  We each had an app, main course, and dessert - EVERY plate was empty by the time they took them away from us.  I had the pate, with a grape marmelade - delish.  Followed it up with the flank steak - it was so tender, I didn't use a knife, and then finished up with the warm peach tart and vanilla ice cream.  My girlfriend is a bit more of a healthier eater - she had a salad with avocado and tomatoes to start, then the grilled salmon with quinoa, and topped it off with a chocolate mousse cake. Just a great experience all around.  Can't wait to go back and try something else."
0,"I really enjoyed brunch at Jane. The ambiance is great and the food was very good. A bit over priced for what you get, but it's still a good time. Service was very good."
1,Too salty..
0,"Lived up to expectations!!  Fresh squeezed orange juice . . . nothing could be better.  Buscatini pasta special was lemony and tangy and I liked it. Maybe not for everyone but gnocchi with spinach and lasagna and panini and arugula tomato pesto salad were fabulous.   And, the espresso at the end was perfect."
1,"After some urging from various friends to try the schwarma sandwich at Mamoun's (I usually rave about Karam's), I finally had a try.  Found amidst the slew of take-out eateries on MacDougal (catering to the late-night bar-hopping crowds?), the offerings are cheap, the service fast.  The schwarma is lamb only, but quite disappointing; perhaps not to my taste, and I've not had a lot of schwarma to benchmark against.  Where did it go wrong?  I prefer more tender meat (its gamy but I don't mind that), more complementary filling, including something pickled to balance, and a stronger tart zing from a yogurt-based sauce that was essentially absent here.  Wish I tried the famed falafel instead.  Also got a tiny side of baba ghanoush but that too, disappointed by having no hint of eggplant and missing some balance on flavors.  Being so cheap and a no commitment snack, I'd consider giving the schwarma another try, but its falafel next time."
0,"Best french fries in NYC, hands down! First went here last year after a late night in the east village and it hit the spot. Was just here last weekend and the fries are always hot, fresh and delicious. There are also 3 dozen flavors for sauce to choose from AND it's open late. Prices very reasonable!"
1,"Forget White Castle, these are the best sliders and their cheap!"
0,Love this place! Great lobster. I try to make it to this place at least a couple times a month. Wonderful food and great location. This is a great location to bring a few friends and enjoy a great meal together.
1,"This place gets deafeningly loud at night.  especially at that long community table.  So, i reccommend going for lunch or get there very early. Outstanding all around. Execusion, quality, atmosphere, service. We had 3 different sliders and 3 sides. All were delicious. Our friendly female server at lunch was such a doll. Loved her suggestions. We net the owners before we left to comlpiment them on their success and they were both friendly and charming. Can't wait to go back and get my balls on! Sorry couldn't help myself."
0,"My daughter brought me here and this was such a winner that we went the next night as well! Where to start? Love the ambiance, service (the first night we had a great woman, 2nd night the guy was awful!) And the food!!!! BBQ Pork buns - a must Tofu and Nasu agedashi - the eggplant (nasu) was delicious! Could do a whole side of only that. Gindara Saikyo Yaki - delicious, but way too small a portion for the price $16!!! I can't even remember which ramen we had..... the first night we each had something different and the 2nd night we tried a different ramen (just one) and did the Kae-dama where you get an extra serving of noodles for $2. This was perfect! And a generous size of extra noodles. We also added extras, which ups the price, but well worth it - can always go for an extra braised pork! They don't take reservations except for the same day.... AND you have to go in.... nothing over the phone! So stop by during lunch and make your evening reservations. Crowded waiting area. But so worth the wait. If you have room for dessert.... walk over to Rice to Riches! :)"
0,My taste buds are still buzzing! Amazing fingers! ...and let's not forget the service...Paul is awesome! He took us in as friends recommended sauces to match the fingers. Great times!
0,"A really nice winebar in the east village.  Really dark.  Very dark.  I tripped several times, but perchance it was the wine.  The bathroom is cool, for those who appreciate those things.  Didn't have the food, but I'll bet its up to par.  Someone at the bar kept changing the music after every song which was really annoying.  Especially when it would change from something good to something god awful"
1,"4.5 stars! I really loved this place and will, without a doubt, be returning. Everyone says great things so I'm going to use this Yelp Review as a reminder for what I can't miss next time. So, future self, please get: - Fluke Carpaccio with Miso (so fresh) - Washu Beef (one of the specials - hopefully it's still there) - Beef Tongue (seriously tender) - Jaga Dango (donut outside, potato-paste inside - mashed potatoes, the consistency of red bean mocha) - Sake Oyake Don (salmon was great, roe was great - rice was just rice) - Chocolate Souffle with raspberry sauce (gooey and delicious) It's ok to skip: - Miso Yaki Onigiri (wasn't really crispy rice - this is better at Yakitori Totto (NYC) and Gochi (Mountain View)) - Buckwheat noodle with soy dipping sauce (my friend loved this, but perhaps I just don't care for the cold noodles) - Pork Belly (super fatty, very tasty - just not as good as the beef tongue) Looking forward to my next visit!!"
0,"The bright green sign caught my eye. I'm always fan of vietnamese food, specially their sandwich and pho. I've been to brookyln and chinatown for a better sandwich. This place is OK. They package it well, it looks nice. But the taste is average. People go there because the place looks cool. There's no competition around. There are a couple of pho places down the block.  But for sandwich, not many. Should open a couple of more."
0,"Burgers are great, beer is good.  Good price.  Little of a wait on a line."
1,"I would give this place 4.5 stars if that was possible.  I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.  The most recent visit I went with... Crab Toast: absolutely spectacular and a relatively decent portion size given that it's an appetizer.   Ricotta appetizer: was pretty good.  Might be that I was comparing it to the magnificent crab toast but I felt like this plate could deliver a bit more. Mushroom Pizza:  Excellent pizza, very fresh and would definitely order again.  However steer clear if you're not a fan of mushrooms or if you don't like soggy bread as the egg can definitely create that situation. Market Fruit dessert: Was a good plate but not as good as a whole foods fruit bucket and twice the cost.  I would probably go with something else for my next visit. Overall an excellent restaurant with great service and exceptional food.  Now if only it was easier to get a table..."
1,"After just moving to the neighborhood, I am SO happy I went to Uva early on. It is fantastic. The first time, I came here with my boyfriend for a small celebratory dinner. We both shared the sun-dried tomato pesto bruchetta, and it was amazing. Super great taste, and the sun-dried tomato taste wasn't too overwhelming! We then each ordered a pasta - I had the classic truffle gnocchi, which definitely lived up to the hype. Super creamy, cheesy, and rich. I couldn't eat the entire plate because it was so rich!  I would definitely recommend it if you're a fan of gnocchi or truffles. My boyfriend got the mushroom pasta, which was just as good! We came a second time to check out their ""late night"" menu, on which they serve pizza, french fries, nutella pizza, macaroni and cheese, and meatball sliders. We ordered the french fries ($7... total rip off, but my boyfriend was craving fries...) and the 3rd pizza on the menu that had tomato sauce, mozarella, oregano, procuitto, and arugula. It was fresh and tasty, although the procuitto was a bit salty for me, but hey isn't that why most people like it? Anyways, I highly recommend Uva. Why not 5 stars? Their service could improve.. I constantly find myself wanting a water re-fill, and sometimes they leave you alone way too long with menus where you're just waiting to order food. Plus, their house bread is mediocre."
1,"For a Latin bar in the East Village, this sure is one homophobic establishment. To the owner, Pitzi you should be ashamed to have Luis and Serge on staff. Luis for calling one of his patrons a fag to their face and Serge the so-called 'manager' for handling the situation by explaining ""that Luis would have the right to use language like that if the patron was acting belligerently or out of line."" There is no room for that type of language period, end of story and no room for a place like Yuca Bar to exist in such an incredible neighborhood, in the best city in the world."
1,Excellent. We hate waiting so we ate at the bar. EXCELLENT service. Had the poached eggs and the skillet breakfasts. Coffee great. Nothing we can rate less than excellent except the bartender in the back scolded us for taking a photo.  That was a bit ridiculous. We will still return. Quaint location and inviting. Almost felt like a pub but with much better food!
0,"First, I am an Alabama boy, so I'm not used to NYC at all, nor can I say much about this kind of food. But I know great-tasting food, and I know a great value. Stood in line for 40 min but enjoyed chatting with friendly (yes, friendly) locals, and then paid $8 a plate for food that was unusual, delicious, and enough to feed two (if we could have contained ourselves!).   We ate here 6 years ago, and the return visit didn't disappoint!  This is a must for any trip to NYC."
1,"A little off the beaten path, but worth going out of the way!  My new staple, its a great spot to meet up with friends for a casual, no frills kind of night which often isn't easy to find in New York.  Great drinks, reasonably priced and the staff is friendly and always suggesting creative new cocktails not on the menu. Side note: if you love the wall decor as much as I do, it was hand painted (not wallpaper).  I am obsessed!"
1,"Is it worth the two hour wait on a Saturday night? Probably not. Did it live up to my expectations after everyone has been talking it up? Probably not. Is it a great restaurant with amazing drinks? I think so. Came here last Saturday with two friends and we had a two hour wait. Went to a bar around the corner until our table was ready. The place is very dark, intimidate, and cozy. It's pretty small and almost feels like it's communal seating because the tables are essentially on top of each other. My friend has swore that the jalapeño margaritas here are the best he's ever had and he is right. I love spicy things and have had many jalapeño margaritas before, and this one was definitely the best. The guac is fresh but it's not as much as other Mexican restaurants tend to give you. For vegetarians, there aren't a lot of options. I think the enchiladas were good, but I don't even remember how they tasted...definitely not bad though. Overall I'm glad I went, and if I ever go back, it'll be just for a drink or on a weekday."
0,"omg this place is out of control... best , best , best... we have shared the lamb tagine and cous cous with chicken.."
0,"Its a nice , friendly and comfortable neighborhood cafe with fresh and honest food with a home feel. Love the Shashuka and the vegetarian tagine couscous ! my carnivore friends gave good marks to the fish taco and the cheeseburger enjoy."
1,The Diablito Quesadilla is fantastic! Could be a dinner to itself - loaded with chorizo. Delish! Am coming back to try other quesadillas.  Really Mexican! Cute place too.
1,"It's my 2nd time to the Meatball shop, first time was so amazing that I've been thinking about eating here several times before I actually come here. First time here, ordered 2 sliders (beef with Parmesan cream and chicken with mushroom gravy) and sauteed broccoli, the sliders were awesome the broccoli was also very very good. My bf ordered mashed potatoes with his sliders, and it was also delicious. He also had a soda float with vanilla ice cream. Our meals were just perfect! Second time here, I ordered the 4 beef meatballs with Parmesan cream with risotto underneath. The meatballs are still very great, but I think the portion is a little bit too much because parmesan cream is very heavy and risotto is kind of heavy too. So tips for the ladies, order sliders instead of the 4 meatballs. I definitely would go to the Meatball shop again, but remember to go earlier if you don't want to wait. We got lucky by going there around noon, and after we were seated, the place was packed within 20 minutes; when we left, people actually have to wait. Also, the restaurant is kind of small, so it could be a long wait."
0,Great gelato!!!
1,"New Yorkers love lines!!  They wait in line for everything.  It's something I don't see much on the west side of the country.  We got there at around 11:30pm and there was already a line out the door.  We had no idea that the restaurant had not opened yet so when the line started moving fast, I was so excited!!  BUT we had one missing person and I heard that they do not let you in without everyone there.  We told the guy that our friend was walking from the subway, which she technically was but she was a bit lost, and he let us in.   Even though they filled the entire restaurant in a span of ten minutes, I was wondering how long the wait would be for our pizzas since there wasn't a staggered ordering structure going on.  Nonetheless, our small pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and extra mozzarella came out in a jiffy.  As for the actual taste, I thought it was a bit bland.  My friend who has come quite a number of times said that there have been days when the pizza is just okay, and days when it is the most spectacular thing in the world.  Today was an okay day.  The pepperonis were delicious and tried to compensate for the lack of taste elsewhere but just couldn't.  The cheese is not so much stringy as it is just plops of fresh mozz, which you may or may not prefer.  Maybe we should've come later in the day so that the pizza guys would have time to warm-up. There's only one bathroom so if you want to go, you have to wait in line right by the pizza makers and the oven.  They don't let you take pictures but I was watching them carefully and the ingredients are just amazingly fresh.  It's a bare bones type of pizza.  The table of four next to us ordered three large pizzas -- omg.  Americans.  They only finished two though thank goodness.   With all the hype, I admit I was disappointed.  I do hope to come again on one of their ""on"" days."
1,"There are way too many thai restaurants on Ninth Ave. I am glad OBAO is NOT just another one. The menu looks much more interesting and has a much better variety than you run-of-the-mill thai place. My friend and I ordered: -sugarcane spare ribs -salt & pepper shrimps -Beef Luclaw -Pho Bo w/  beef balls -coconut ice-cream Everything was tasty, especially the spare ribs, salt & pepper shrimp and coconut ice cream. The decor was beautiful and service was attentive. Definitely worth another visit or more."
0,"Went for lunch, had amazing food but lackluster service (one staff member for the bar and all tables), but totally worth it.  Came for dinner and had food and a full on blackout tequila experience that was everything such an experience should be. Pork tacos. Steak tacos. Calamari tacos.  Can't go wrong."
1,"I enjoyed the food, the drinks, the environment and the price, but why go here? Marlow and Sons is right door. SO much better. I still need to try the burger though."
1,Food was great - service could have been better
0,"I was very excited to finally try this place, since I heard so much about it. I gotta say, i was a bit disappointed, the best pizza in new York? I can't imagine! It was an ok pizza, but I've had much better! Nothing like a real nice pizza from Italy! The staff was very nice and service was great though and it didn't take long for the food to be delivered"
0,"Wafa's is a classic. Probably the best food in the Forest Hills area. Restaurant service is not the best (though it's at least always friendly), but if that bothers you just take out or order in. You can't beat the food."
0,Not that good..not that bad..a little overpriced..but that's the cost of italian thing in US...
1,"5 stars for food, 3 for the loud noise.   The lobster & crab ravioli is the best!  great prices and attentive service."
0,The flavors on the salad and the pasta dish were very good. The portion of pappardelle however was not. There were six (6) pieces of pappardelle for two meatballs and the portion left much to be desired (like more pappardelle). The management's response however was the most unsatisfactory  response I've received in a restaurant (that's the way the dish is made). Maybe that's why there weren't more patrons.
1,"Best Falafel in the city! Been there forever, extremely cheap, and the hot sauce is crazy hot! Baklava is pretty amazing too!"
1,"Laduree has absolutely delicious macarons. It does not need my 5 star rating but I had to profess my love for these macarons! The line goes pretty quick if everyone knows which macarons they want beforehand. The pistachio is a must have. I got 6 macarons in a pretty box for over $20 --so it is on the pricey side. Still, it is a great indulging experience. My friends from out of town love these macarons so it would make a delicious goody gift shipped out overnight. Although I would recommend eating them right away I had some two days after and they were STILL delicious."
1,"Out of all the bars we visited while in NYC and Brooklyn, Employees Only was by far my favorite. The drinks were phenomenal, and my friends enjoyed the snacks. I really wish we had come on a day like Tuesday to get a more intimate experience and really test the bartender's muscles, but instead I was amazed at how attentive and polite the bartenders were for a Saturday night on a Holiday weekend mind you. They were so aware of when an unfortunate fella behind us ladies got too stumbly on us strangers, and insisted he find  his way out, while informing other staff members. I can't say that happens often, but I was pleasantly surprised! There may be a line, but the guy working the door is super nice. Will definitely be paying a visit when we return!"
0,"The DW has a great eclectic crowd and exceptional food. I've been there a few times and always wind up leaving after a great conversation, great food, and awesome beer. Also, I'm kind of obsessed with Mindy - she's not only charming and attentive, but gorgeous. Cheers DW - great experience all around."
1,"SImple and fast - great food and amazing cocktails!! The staff is attentive and friendly adding suggestions and carring a sweet conversation with the typical Brazilian smile! I was there on a date and it was so nice as the place is tiny getting us very close to each other, some kind of confort zone... the bathroom needs an upgrade or at least to get the brum removed from there :) please make sure to try the Black Bean Soup, its unique! But also at least share a desert - it is a must!"
1,"first time having halal food got the rice combo came with chicken,lamb rice and pita bread the chicken and lamb really juicy and flavor, becareful with the red sauce its  really really hot like fire put alot on my plate and could not finish it  was really hot the white sauce is really good  next time im going to come back to the halal cart for sure but next time im using more of the white sauce and less of the red sauce over all a good deal  9 bucks for  a combo plate  and drink"
0,"Okay so we stumbled across this. Stalled before going in to see a menu (from outside looked rundown). Was impressed with seeing inside. A lot bigger than first thought. Clean and tidy with a dated look. Was offered warm rolls to begin with from a basket. Food was amazing. We had burgers, pasta and chicken pie. We all cleared our plates. We also had deserts, wine and soda. The bill for 4 of us was only about £60! Bargain :)"
1,"I come here often with friends from work and they have always been very accommodating. Their lunch special prices are pretty amazing and always consistent. Where can you get an entree and two appetizers for $7.95? The best thing I like about it is that they bring out your food in less than 5 minutes! Service is good; the staff is very polite and friendly. The food is good. I mostly get the Pad Thai and switch up the appetizers. They have good spring rolls and dumplings with peanut sauce. It's a cute little place to sit down and enjoy a meal. I often see people dining by themselves during lunch. Like I said earlier, it's hard to beat their prices."
1,"I didn't eat at the restaurant, I placed an order for pick up. The place is small though, and probably only can sit about 20 people total.  I ordered three different empanadas. I ordered one chicken, one beef, and one chorizo empanada. And although these empanadas appeared to be a little on the small side, you know what they say? Don't judge a book by its' cover. And boy was that true, these little things packed a punch, the empanadas were stuffed with meat and the different hot sauces and salsas were equally delicious. I'd say my favorite one was the chorizo because it had a little kick to it. To be honest, after eating one of them I was pretty  full, but it was so good I didn't want to stop. By far the best empanada experience I've ever encountered in my lifetime."
0,"In fairness, this review has nothing to do with the food because I didn't have the chance to eat there. Since they aren't on opentable, I made a reservation three weeks in advance for my mother's birthday by phone.  I received a confirmation email, but I didn't look at the text.   Fast forward to the night before, when I opened the email to see what time I needed to arrive, and I noticed it said two people instead of one.  I called to try to straighten it out.  I emailed the general manager.  (Apparently, they won't talk to consumers who have complaints.  Or even get back to them in a timely fashion.)  He offered me 5:30pm, which we couldn't make. (Our reservation was @6:15 on a Thursday night.   I offered to postpone the reservation, for a week, and he offered us 5:45, which was again too early.   When I said, no, he told me he would keep me posted about cancellations.  I am not that desperate to eat there.  I wanted my mother to have a good meal in a fancy place for her birthday.  That didn't happen because they mixed up my reservation.   Long story short, if you want to eat at this place, make sure that the confirmation email is correct.  And, if it is not, call them right away, because they will not accommodate  you.  Or even be nice about it.  And don't make it for a special occasion because if something goes wrong on their end, they won't be accommodating."
1,Went for lunch. We came exactly at 12:00 and sat in the Tavern section. The table we were sitting at in this section was a bit on the uncomfortable side - to eat at; but it was all secondary when the food arrived. The desert was amazing too. The service was very good as well. Good place to take your parents when they come into town...
1,"I'm not picky when it comes to my halal so I only venture here when I'm entertaining friends when the ""famous halal cart"" is always on their list of must-eats. At night, I'll always walk friends by the SW cart first so they can see the spectacle before walking them across the street to the SE cart where there is no line for the same food. Somehow lamb and rice tastes better when you don't have to wait. P.S.: They also have a new East Village spot in front of their under-construction brick-and-mortar store. Same great food sans the waiting."
1,"Came here for a team holiday outing during the holiday season. The host staff were really pleasant and friendly which was a good starting point. They put aside a good chunk of the restaurant for our party of about 18. We had a set menu based on our large party. First thing I noticed was there weren't nearly enough servers keeping an eye on us. With a party of 18 there should always be someone on the lookout but so often we had to flag down a waiter for a refill and with that large a group refills were needed about every two seconds. It would have made more sense if they had just allowed us to keep the bottles on our table and honestly was disruptive since we always had to be on the lookout. The food wasn't special. The bread was good, pizza was decent (I expected more from that brick oven), and I was not one bit impressed by my chicken entree. It was irritating when we ordered our entree because the waitress simply asked ""chicken or pasta?"" without any detail on what the entree included. Found that ridiculous especially given peoples food preferences and restrictions nowadays. On top of that, both entrees were unappetizing. The doughnut dessert however was out of this world...yum! We were with a fun group which is why these little things didn't make a mess of our evening, but if I came with just a friend I'd be pretty disappointed. Most likely won't be visiting Sotto13 again."
0,"This is the worst restaurant in NYC. Rude staff, overpriced meals and awful food quality. There are 100's of great places in NYC to eat, leave this one alone."
1,"It's Independence Day...and what better way to rub my America all up in another country's face than to eat their indigenous creatures BECAUSE I CAN. Australians are awfully close to the British (as is my understanding), so I rolled into the Thirsty Koala, ordered up their gentlest marsupial in steak form and ate it. Why? America, that's why. Guess what, Dundee- these colors don't run...not even from your grass nibbling, deer faced, outback rats. I'll eat your fancy, imported pouch meats. I don't care. I'm all jacked up on Budweiser and I've been throwing darts at a picture of General Cornwallis all morning. Sure I feel a little bad about smacking your incredibly friendly staff upside the head with a fat dose of red, white and blue, but I'm a rock and roll bald eagle in cowboy boots and I don't know any other way to kick it. Great lunch specials, cool vibe and lots of vegetarian options for wannabe Frenchmen who don't have rare beef and lightning flowing through their veins. Maybe you should stick to the olive tapenade, artichoke and goat cheese sandwich which my wife thought was heavenly. As for me- I suggest you try the kangaroo so rare it hops into your mouth. Try this place. In closing, Lynyrd Skynyrd rulez."
0,"They used to be great, Lately the food was very disappointing. We kept coming back giving them another chance and its just so inconsistent. One night can be very good and the next night you can get soggy croutons in the salad and cold mussel broth..."
0,A solid Indian restaurant. I would have preferred to have more onions in my onion rava dosa though. The palak paneer (spinach paneer) is good. I like that the paneer is not soggy/too soft.
0,I love the square slices and the ices :))
0,"Great bargain for NYC. The waitstaff is excellent and the food is good. The calamari is good for an appettizer. For dinner, I had the strip bass  few times and was xtremely pleased."
0,Great little place. Stopped in for a quick bite with a couple of friends. Got lucky and caught the tail end of happy hour prices for oysters - no need to pay $2 and $3 per for top notch oysters. Really fresh and expertly shucked. We shared spaghetti and meatballs - the Sunday special. Nice portion and pretty darn tasty. Bottom line : nice clean place. Reasonable prices for above average table fare.
1,"This meal started with a lovely session of people watching on a swinging bench. It was a beautiful fall day and we got harassed by some psycho dressed like a pirate. The day could not have been more perfect but then everything went way down hill from there. The biscuits are usually amazing here but we must have gotten a bad batch. They were poorly cooked and way, way too doughy. There were multiple items of dirty silverware on the table and major attitude from the Maître d' about it after asking for clean forks and knives. I also managed to sit on some scrambled eggs... After waiting for an hour to sit down and literally watching the table lay dormant inside for 10 minutes is it really too much to ask for a clean table??? We had random waiters for the entire meal while seemingly ever other table had just one. Guess we shouldn't have complained about the silverware? Wait staff forgot about a side and Maître d' acted like he was doing us a huge favor bringing one out on the house, only to come back a minute later to complain that the side was on someone else's plate, who guess what? They ordered it. I had a burger and it was OK but the fries were cold. Everyone else with me had A-Ok omelettes' but nothing to write home about. Also, why is this place cash only? It is a large restaurant on a busy street in Tribeca... There was a citibank across the street though. The food was really subpar considering all the hype and hunger we had going into the meal and the rude, distasteful service for complaining about legitimate issues is just not right. Hopefully this was just an off day. I really wanted to love this place, maybe I will give it another try in a few weeks."
1,"I REALLY REALLY REALLY enjoyed coming here!! Yes, there is a humongous line but worth the wait!! Ordered the White Pizza (Large) with Sausage and Pepperoni. So hungry and eagerly waiting for our pizza we were eyeing everyone elses pies!! Ours came out like 10 mins after ordering and we INHALED it!!! Crisp crust, fresh ingredients, amazing!! The fresh mozzarella was delish and creamy. The pepperoni were thick and oh so tasty. Sausage had a good spice. You can definitely taste the difference in the pizza by how they bake it in a coal oven. The taste is more smoky and that distinguishes this place from the rest of the NYC pizza joints I have tried (Rays, Lombardis, Angelos). I am seriously craving for more!! And this stuff is way better than ANYTHING you get in Cali!! (The sad sad truth!!) Pizza will never taste the same again......"
1,Great halal food cart.  Why do you think there's always a line here?  Definitely add A LOT of white yogurt sauce and a little of the hot sauce.  Too much hot sauce ruins the food.
1,"I like the lively atmosphere created by the small space.  It was a fun place to dine at on a Friday night, even though we had to wait a bit.  Excellent appetizers and entrees.  I had the chicken...something or other.  I'm sure the other entrees are just as tasty.  But the mojitos were not very good.  Maybe it was an off night..."
0,"Great margaritas, in-expensive, eco-friendly, great environment, no employees harassing you, the seats outdoors are nice when it's hot, friendly atmosphere. A+"
0,Best pizza in Brooklyn!!
1,"Come for the adorable atmosphere. Stay for the good cappuccino, seriously delicious homemade lemonade, refreshingly not-too-sweet chai lattes, and decent wifi connection. But mostly come for the atmosphere."
0,"We ate at Bouley for our 5th anniversary and it was by far, the most amazing dinner we had ever had. We both had their tasting menu with the wine pairing and the food, wine, and service was incredible! (and we are both avid cooks ourselves!) Our servers gave us a special dessert and 6th course (for free) for our anniversary. It was well worth the money, our hats off to Mr. David Bouley!"
1,Wow. Wow. Wow. This place just keeps getting better every time I eat here. The original Red Hook location is crazy good. The Manhattan location is great too but this one is miles beyond! Huge sandwich. Incredible taste and portions. Seems like it's in the middle of nowhere by the battery tunnel but it's worth the journey. This is where they blindfold you and club you over the head so you won't give away the location of this legendary 1922 landmark. It's like discovering the Shangri-La of sandwich spots.
0,"I'm usually satisfied with this place, but today the ""manager"" was very rude to us. We were a party of 5, waiting for 30 minutes to get a table. First, they didn't make any effort to accommodate us, and were filling the large tables with couples, but that wasn't as bad as their attitude. After 30 minutes of wait the ""manager"" asked us to wait outside, and we asked to stay inside because it was windy and still cold. She said that we should leave then. That was really rude and inappropriate, because we are regulars and would wait longer to get seated. Dissapointed."
1,Finally i came to this place! Been hearing and reading alot about it. Pizza was great! Drinks were really really good. Sangria was very good as well. Atmosphere is date appealing as well as just kicking back to a meal. Highly recommend it.
1,"3 stars... Ahh..I'm sorry. I know there is so much history and prestige riding along Lombardi's pizza, but honestly, I really don't see what all the hype was. My first visit to NYC and I definitely bookmarked Lombardi's. I wanted genuine, NY style pizza, and from what I've heard from numerous friends, this was the place to go. For a small pizza (great for two people) you pay a base price and with each additional topping it's either $2-3 depending if you wanted it on your whole pie or just half of the pizza. My friend and I shared a half Portobello mushroom half Italian meatball pizza. It was good. But I wouldn't say phenomenal. The good: -nice crispy crust -love the usage of slices of mozzarella instead of shredded -not overwhelming amount of sauce -the meatball was moist and delicious -definitely healthier and less greasy than most pizzas I'm use to The not so good -the mushroom made that half of the pizza a bit soggy -although the sauce was good..it was just a little off for me. Perhaps I'm used to a sweeter sauce? -flavors on the meatball was good, but overall flavor of the entire pizza was just okay. -i wish it was cheesier In my opinion, it was a tad bit overpriced. However, the small did serve two people (with an appetite) perfectly. We weren't super stuff and after eating the pizza didn't have that gross bloated feeling...so win? Give it a try."
1,"Really liked the food last time we went. But, this time the 3 of us felt like sitting in the bar. It's Sunday night at 7:30 and the place was empty (maybe 6 tables seated with about 15 empty)...and the bar was less ""stuffy"" than the main room so we asked if we could sit there.  But we were told we could only eat from the bar menu...or sit at the kitchen bar (just a few feet away). The bar menu was limited and the kitchen bar was not great for conversation (as we just got out of a movie and wanted to talk). We asked if we could sit in the bar room with full menu as it was empty and the kitchen staff seems not busy at all. Nope. Not possible. We got a little attitude as well. Ok ... We decided to sit in the dinning room. Once seated we asked the floor manager if we could sit in the bar with full menu (assuming they would be accommodating when the restaurant was not very full and we had a reservation). Nope. This was not the Chef's policy. Even if we were the only people there.  My friend asked if he could order from the bar menu. Yes. But...no burgers in the main room. Wow. The floor manager (who was nice - but seemed bound by the policy) offered to talk with the Chef (if we wanted her to)...but at that point we were over it. It felt out of place that she put that on us to request.   She did say that we could come back at lunch time and eat the full menus where ever we wanted to - only making us more frustrated by what we had been told before about the flow of the kitchen and the Chef's policy. What blew our mind was that we would have spent a couple hundred bucks with food and drinks - but they let us walk out rather than upset the ""flow of the kitchen"" on a quiet night...even though they were mostly empty. Wow."
0,"I ate here right before I moved to Chicago.  The office girls threw me a going away party and the wait staff did not disappoint!  They made sure we had a great experience.This place is new, and I wish it had opened years ago so I could have gone more often! First, The atmosphere:  Very cozy and quaint, sophisticated. You smell the food as soon as you are in the door!  Loved the amuse bouche offering. Food;  We split several appetizers and not a one disappointed us.  There is a lot of mushroom on the menu and in the ingredients, and one of my girlfriends is allergic.  The staff was happy to help her choose something suitable.  I had the pasta sampler, which was to die for! I highly recommend this for a nice adult gathering or first date."
1,"Another one of the touted ""Best Burgers"" in NYC, I'd have to say that Corner Bistro fell short. Certainly a good sized, plump burger and cooked precisely to order and in prompt fashion (despite the packed house and ever-growing line).  It's not a bad burger - it just falls short of what this city has to offer.  The patty was blatantly under seasoned, and lacked the juiciness and general depth of flavor that other burger joints in the city have been able to achieve with their various specialty blends. Plus, with lines that grow and multiply at alarming rates, especially during peak hours, I would have to say that this is NOT one of the places that I would endure an extended wait if you are hoping to be rewarded for your troubles by an outstanding burger at the end of it all."
0,"Went here with a friend on a Tuesday night with a Gilt voucher.  We were treated like kings.  We got Buffalo and Salted Caramel fingers, carrot fries and cajun fries, and the Sticky's sauce, thai sweet chili, ranch, and wasabi aioli.  Oh also mexican cokes and a free shot of whiskey!!!  The Salted caramel, sticky's sauce and carrot fries were my favorites but everything was bangin!  They're open super late, which is great to know and we'll be back for post-drinking late night snacks (SO much better then yet another papaya dog).  Also TJ the cashier and delivery guy was awesome!!  Things on 8th Street seem to come and go, so give these good business so they'll stick around!"
0,Decent noodles but the wait is long (45 minutes to an hour).
1,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city! The atmosphere is great but the food is what makes it a place I want to visit until I try everything on the menu! I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order, so I recommend looking at the menu and getting a dish according the ingredients you like. I would take my parents here for dinner or brunch with girlfriends."
0,"Best Indian in all of NYC! No kidding. So here's how I describe it since I'm sure what's going through your head right now has a tune along the lines of ""yeah but everyone has such different opinions about what makes good indian food"". Ghandi tastes the way authentic Indian food would taste IF it tasted like I imagined it should. That's about the best compliment I could give seeing as how I actually like Indian food. Since I discovered this place I have gone once a week without fail. I eat there in person every time (so I can't say how it tastes delivered but that's ok, get off your a$$ and eat out for a change Brooklyn!) and and it's divine. I've taken friends and they all agree. I've taken the most worldly of people and they TOO agree. Of course, I know we all have different opinions of what makes good Indian  food, right? So, here's my final testament. My roommate finally went on my recommendation and he's from Mumbai. He came home and what he had to say about it was that it was just like home cooked Indian food. Homestyle I guess you could say. And his Indian friends who were with him agreed and commented that they felt like they were being served by their parents back in Indian since it was so uncanny. That's that. Try it. You won't regret it."
1,"Finally made it to the Pig......had the burger and was not disappointed!  Wow.  Made the mistake of trying all the bar snacks beforehand so I think I killed my appetite a bit. Deviled Eggs = BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Devil's On Horseback- a stuffed prune wrapped in bacon? Yes please! Olives and Pickles.....lovely. The Burger was insane.  Med/Rare, juicy as all hell, wonderful bun and Roquefort cheese....I really had to force the last of it down I was so full and like a jerk I ordered the flourless chocolate cake.  Food Coma followed. The House Bitters was excellent as well as the Salty Dog and Dark and Stormy with housemade ginger beer. Clientele......pretty douchey.  Lot's of fashion victims and hipsters who knock by you and are too cool to say ""pardon me"" or ""excuse me"". I was trying to close my check at the bar to head to the table and ""Hipster A"" wouldn't move over an inch (after I politely asked him twice) so I could actually sign off my bill. No matter, when you give these pussies an elbow to the ribs, they move their candy asses.  I'm no toughguy, I just won't stand for shit manners. The bartender was a bit jaded but became a sweety because I was actually saying ""please"" and ""thank you"".  She was covered in groovy tattoos and makes a great drink, thanks love! We'll be back.  Good eats.  Hipsters will be vanquished....again."
0,"This place is amazing, it really is. I was never a big fan of sushi until coming here. My wife made me try a few different rolls and I actually liked them all. I would def recommend to anyone who wants to change their views on sushi. Seems like the freshest one that I have ever tried."
0,"If you're in the city with family or a small to mid-sized group, and you want quality Italian food without taking out a second mortgage, this place is perfect.   I've never had a bad meal here, and the service is attentive and friendly.   The fact that it's in Times Square shouldn't be a turnoff, like most places that are there.   I've been here a dozen times and wouldn't hesitate to bring family, with our without kids, or folks from out of town who make you do the obligatory trek through Times Square with them."
0,So good. Can't get enough of this place!!
1,"I wish there was a way to review each aspect of a place with a star rating. Well, I'll just list them below for now, as it's a mixed bag, and there's no way to appropriately weight them. Food: 4 stars. Crab was fresh and enjoyable, absolutely no complaints. Beer: 1 star. Selection isn't bad, but it's all sour, funky or warm. Tap lines might have been broken, but it was deplorable. Although, this is probably the beer snob in me. Location: 5 stars. Far out, but with a good view and makes you feel like you're in a different world. Which is nice and refreshing for NYC. Service: 1 star. Slow, uncaring, and just not interesting in being there. I watched multiple tables staring around for things like napkins, more water, etc. There's typically a long wait here, we were able to avoid that during off hours on an off day, but it was still a good experience with good food, and both really enjoyed what we ate. However, some things still need to be worked out, and that's pretty apparent based on the other reviews. It's worth visiting if you want some crab, I will likely be back (during off hours)."
0,"We decided to try this place out for our anniversary even after reading mixed reviews. We got there around 6:30 on a Saturday night and I have to say there was really no wait like people where talking about with lines out the door, we were seated right away. The place reminded me of an old basement that badly need to be updated and the bathrooms really needed a good cleaning. That would not have mattered if the service and food was good..  We knew before we even got there that we wanted the stuffed artichokes.  We ordered  for dinner Stuffed Artichokes, Baked Clams. Chicken Scarpariello,  Shrimp Luciano and broiled Steak.  After we placed our order the waiter that had no personality and was rude came back and told us that they ran out of artichokes.  While trying to decide what we wanted instead, we were rushed and told that we couldn't have a minute to decide because he had to put the order in. The waiter brought us plates which had dried food stuck to them and we had to share knives because the waiter said they were short on utensils. The appetizers were fine but not amazing as per other reviews, then the steak came , which we ordered medium and it came not only rare.....but RAW!  We asked to cook it some more which annoyed him and he brought it back to us two minutes later and it was still raw.  We were all disgusted at that point so we did not eat it and told the waiter this. Again he seemed annoyed.  We eat out a lot and have never had this bad service.  Not only did we pay $68 for a steak that nobody ate, but we had to deal with a nasty attitude from the waiter and everyone left hungry.  We were not asked throughout our whole meal how everything was and we were never offered dessert or coffee either.  The check was thrown on the table and we paid and left a tip which wasn't deserved.  Needless to say , we will not be returning."
1,"Public Enemy said it best ""Don't Believe The Hype"". haha. A bit overrated for me. Pizza was good, but I've had better. I went here with some peeps and had to wait outside in line 20-25 minutes. Service inside was ok and pizzas came out relatively quick. The place is kind of small for all the people. The pizzas itself though? ehhh...I prefer Pizza Hut Meat lovers and Stuffed Crust better than this place."
0,"hummm this restaurant is so nice. Pasta are fabulous, and the burger terrific! The place is small but really cute. One of my favorite place."
1,"Sake Bar Hagi is hidden in the basement and not well known by tourists. You'll need to be familiar with the area in order to find this place. Arrive early or else you'll be left waiting in a very long line. You want to get here before it opens to secure a spot because by the time we left, the place was packed. Here's what's good because this isn't your typical Japanese restaurant. Wassabi shumai (yes it will definitely clear your sinuses), duck, chicken and pork yakitori, fried squid legs, salmon sashimi, fried chicken, chicken wings are items you should order. These dishes are little plates of food, similar to Tapas. We were able to devour them quickly so make sure you order enough to go around. We also drank Sapporo and an entire bottle of sake. I unfortunately don't remember the name of it though. I'll update the review once I get pictures from that night. Stay away from the mackerel and stir fry noodles. There was too much fish bone in the mackerel and it required a lot of work to eat it. If I wanted stir fry noodles, I can eat that at a Chinese restaurant. I was watching Anthony Bourdain after I ate here and now I understand what the sushi chefs meant when they wanted to eat at a place where they didn't eat what they made all day long. If you're looking for Japanese food that doesn't include sushi or rolls, come here for something different."
0,The place is expensive but worth every penny-cause the food and the service were both amazing!!!
1,"Overall, I enjoyed Stella 34. The food was delicious and the servings were generous. We ordered the fried risotto ball, octopus salad, lasagna, and spicy cuttlefish ink pasta. The ink pasta had a good dose of spiciness. The lasagna should be served with a knife, because the embedded black kale across the layers made it difficult to eat."
0,This is Amanda's restaurant from chopped?  Wow just had lunch there and was awful...the omelette was dry and boring...came with a little pathetic salad..bacon was soggy ..bread was two slices of very soft and boring toast....got one glass of diet coke and was never offered a refill....the walls by the boo we were sitting at could use a good cleaning too..
1,"I went to The Bar Room for brunch and had a solid meal! The waitstaff are incredibly nice, the food was tasty (everyone was really happy with what they ordered), and the space itself is lovely - it has an old-school vibe, and there are high ceilings with a skylight that create a very light and airy atmosphere. The bill was also completely reasonable for the quality of the meal. I had the grilled chicken sandwich with arugula pesto, aged cheddar and spicy tomato jam, my boyfriend had the burger (comes with tons of thick-cut fries on the side!), my cousin had the bacon & lobster frittata (filled with big pieces of lobster and a lot of perfectly ripe, sliced avocado on top!), and her boyfriend had the smoked salmon & bagel plate with a side of eggs. As I mentioned, everyone was very satisfied with what they ordered. I definitely recommend The Bar Room for a low-key brunch!"
0,"Today I went to this place, Kitchen 79 for dine in, I fall in love with this place!! The restaurant look really really cozy, new, clean, modern, silvery, and black-white. So the interior really good. Service from them very nice there is the lady who took care of me today and she talk to very nice, she can be another friend of you, a great friend!!! Food at this place is amazing!! I have never try any Thai food like this in the area before!! I felt , it's real Thai food! I had the Pad Kra Paw Ka Moo with Moo Satay today both of them are amazing. I Would recommend this place for you, if you want to try something good and new for you!!"
0,"I have two regular coffee spots (one around home and one around work, i'm not a traitor!) and this is one of them. Never once have I had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly, the drinks on point. What else would I need? Keep on keepin on Orlin..."
0,"Don't go here if you want a sterile atmosphere.  Do go here if you like it cozy, warm, romantic and artful. Every item on the menu is superb.  As a regular, I'd recommend the fried oyster appetizer, the cioppino (a San Francisco, Italian-American seafood chowder filled with lobster, shrimp, assorted fresh fish chunks in the most succulent sauce), and almost any grilled fish - snapper, bass,  salmon, tuna etc.  Everything is always fresh and perfectly prepared.   But choose anything from the menus, copies of which are on the walls, and you can't go wrong.  There are even some excellent meat items, such as the perfectly-grilled strip steak, should your party include non-seafood pallets. It's BYOB, which is great since you can purchase wines from a neighboring shop across the street and save a bundle of money. While the atmosphere is funky, the service is attentive. And another plus - after dinner you can stop into the wine bar next door, owned by the same management, and choose from a wide assortment of wines and artisanal beers while listening to great music - piano, guitar or cool jazz, depending on which evening you stop in.   Trust me - go here and go often.  I do."
0,"This is by far my favorite place in N.Y.C. From the time it opened ans had a doorman named Lincoln(restaurants with doormen, cute..lol) The seafood is unrealistically fresh and so deliciously enticing. I prefer a round,  leather booth in the back where it's a little quieter. I've always found the service to be excellent,  the food and beverages fantastic and oysters and a filthy martini are the perfect cure for a snowy, cold winters day."
0,"Awful. Not sure which is worse, the food or the service. I live in the neighborhood and have been going to brunch here for years.  The food has deteriorated to the point of inedibility and the service, which was never it's strong point to begin with, is now downright abysmal.  Don't get suckered, avoid this spot."
0,"1st timer and I'm hooked!!!  Atmosphere and deco fab!!!  Food, yummy and small enough to taste it all and still booze it up.  And the desserts - perfect sampler sizes to have um ALL!!!!!   Great place to chill, munch on many different things, drink and enjoy your friends and background music!!!!"
1,"Cute interior, friendly staff, good food and affordable pricing earned Bianca's 5 stars. The inside of this place is on the small side, so I wouldn't recommend taking a group here--especially since they don't take reservations.  But for a date night, I can hardly think of a better destination. Everything about our meal last week was spot on.   We started with the artichoke salad-- very tasty, and moved on to the homemade ravioli--good, but not spectacular and the crispy salmon--out of control good! We ended with an afodado and a hazelnut gelato, which I think are made in house (?) anyway, they were the perfect end to our meal. Maybe I'll see you there, because I'll definitely be back for more!"
1,"It is a pretty decent place near TQ, but it is nothign compared with the places in St. Marks. off the top of my head, Kenka and Oh! Tashi are better. This place has pretty unique dishes, like the pasta dish with some sort of a cream fish sauce, that was delic. The place is very small and feel crammed, and its in the basement of another restaurant. I would suggest go to St. Marks unless you happen to be in the area"
0,"A very cool hip bar with great looking people and friendly bartenders (actually mixologists) that know how to truly make a truly delicious cocktail !  If you are unsure of what you are in the mood to drink- tell them what kind of liquor(s) you like and let them do their magic- trust me- you will be happy. The place feels like a classic speakeasy but naturally, not like they tried too hard to be one, like many bars these days.  I didn't try the food but what passed by me looked like they put as much care into the food as they do the cocktails.  Like others are writing, the bar area is very busy (and crowded) but hey-i'm just there for a cocktail or two- i'm not moving in!"
1,"It's good, really liked the smokey flavor of my ramen, but not as good as Ippudo and only a little higher than the blander ramen you'll find at Momofuku. The restaurant itself is incredibly cramped which didn't help me enjoy the food."
1,"SUGAR CURED BACON *almost* better than SEX oh man. ok, so i should just face it. I am not the vegetarian I claim to be. This was fuckin fantastic. I could not resist the pig. After I forced my most beloved yelper dining companions to an hour and a half wait... We started with brunchy type drinks in an overpriced small glass. No all you can drink at this place. Damn. They should lose a star, but they  are just so blissfully yummy. I can't. I got their famous wild maine blueberry pancakes. Had been dreaming of pancakes. Now, I'm dreaming of sugar cured bacon. Plates and plates of it. My stomach was not as big as my eyes, so I ordered a buttermilk biscuit, mixed berry scone and peanut choc chip cookie to go. And had them that night.  I think I ate well that day. Let's be clear - this place is fantastic - but I sincerely hope you don't want to wait and wait and wait for a seat here. SO I CAN  GET IN FASTER  :-P"
1,"You can't say you've been to Chinatown without having sat down at this family run restaurant famous for their dry and/or soup noodles and country style duck. The duck is the best in NYC. Lots of flavor, dark in color and savory in taste. Great on it's own, over noodles or with some rice. But I come here for my absolute favorite bowl of noodles. Noodles are like a Chinese person's comfort food. I always get the beef balls with pearl noodles in soup. Good beef balls are almost crunchy in texture, which is exactly how Bo Ky gets it. You only get that by constantly pounding the beef and introducing air into it. Legend has it that a perfect beef ball is one that can bounce like a ball. I don't know if BoKy has quite gotten it that good, but it's an interesting factoid. My hubby is a bit more adventurous than me. He loves a pigs feet over rice or a seafood noodle soup or some intestinal appetizers. But not everyone has the stomach for that kind of stuff."
0,"Petite is better for brunch.  I don't recommend the dinner/lunch food, overpriced.  Brunch is good, large portions.  Also, great beer selection."
1,"Horrible service! Went to brunch at 2:30... not even prime brunch time. Luckily we got seated right away and didn't have to wait for a table.  There were tables around us empty as well as I would say they were busy but definitely not at capacity by any means. I'm pretty sure 20 minutes went by before we could get anyone to take our drink order. Finally we ordered drinks and then they wanted to go away before taking our food order. As we were pretty hungry or more impatient probably from the slow service we ordered the food all at once.   We ordered the artichoke dip to start which was very tasty. The reviews are all right on this one... A must order if you are going to go to Freeman's. After another 20 minutes half he people at our table got their drinks (those who ordered wine). It took another 15 minutes for those who ordered cocktails to get their drinks. Food took a while but at least we had our drinks, artichoke dip and friends. Once the food came it was pretty good and we all enjoyed it. Not once did we get the server ask how our food was or if we wanted anything else. We finished the meal and probably waited another 20 minutes to find someone to get the check from. I understand places are busy in NYC for brunch but seriously this was a bit much.  Food was relatively cheap but your bill could quickly add up if your drinking. Food was good but I'm not rushing back here any time soon."
1,"Amazing neighborhood spot. The Zuppe de Pesce is fantastic. For pasta, the cavatelli with pesto, shrimp, and salmon is delicious. Great service, and a really good inexpensive house wine. Been here about 10 times and anyone I bring with me loves it."
1,"Whenever I'm remotely near the area I try to find an excuse to swing by one of the Halal Guy carts (they have carts on both sides of the street). The line is always shorter on the east side of the street so I'm usually at that one. For 6bucks you get an ungodly amount of food! If you ever go to any other halal food cart they usually give you a small rectangle styrofoam box with a little rice and a little meat, about half what these guys give you!.....Here, its 3 heaping scoops of rice, pile high the meat, and then throw on a handful of pita bread! You know its alot of food when the container is big and round and the size of your face and the guy still has to smash everything down a little to get the cover on. Plus that thing is HEAVY in your hands. And now the sauces, Yes the white sauce is crack...it's heroin in a bottle, I tell you, The meat is nice and lean so it soaks up the sauces wonderfully. But for me (a girl that LOVES spice) I'm all for the red sauce. Yes it's lava, pure lava, but I don't care! I'll gladly endure the weird oogling, ""you must be crazy"" looks from other patrons as I slather it all over my food. Don't look at me in shock, and don't you dare give me the pitying ""oh she must be new, a tourist and not know how hot it is"" look...I know and I love it! Now go away and grow a pair! LOL I want to feel the burn and dance in it. I always ask for extra little 'hot sauce'  containers on the side with my food when they pack it, but then use their big squirt bottles to pour sauce on it instead. This way I have 3-4 little containers I can bring home. People, if they sold this sauce I'd buy it in bulk. I marinade meat in it,  put it in my pasta, add it to my sauces etc.... I don't eat here often (it's a lot of food and if I ate here everyday I""d be a whale) but when I do it's always a treat. Go, get in line, and prepare yourself for a little tub of heaven :)"
0,"ABSOLUTELY love this place. Food, drinks, atmosphere, staff ... everything was freaking fantastic!! I would say this isn't the kind of place to start a giant night out, the food's really rich ... this is your destination and it's totally worth it."
0,"The Upper West Side has a serious lack of cool, fun, tasty places to go hang out. Thankfully, Jacobs pickle tackles this problem head on. A wide selection of craft beer and interesting pickled items make for a great laid back night of drinking and snacking. Also, an inventive and fun cocktail list (spicy habenero brine margarita!) keeps me interested even when I'm in the mood for something sleeker and stronger. The place itself has a great design, with a storefront that opens up fully, community table in front, and farm inspired decor. Service has always been up to par here as well. They lose the 5th start due to consistency issues. A number of the times i have been, they have been out of stock on certain beers. In addition, the pickles are not always consistent. Sometimes crunchier than other times, sometimes spicier, sometimes sweeter. Overall, an excellent addition to the UWS, and i love anywhere that pays homage to American Craft brews in as big and a fun way as Jacobs Pickle does. ."
0,"Hands down the current best in astoria's sea greek seafood eateries, a very saturated category in these streets. impreccably fresh, expertly cooked. a huge con that prevents it from a glaring red 5 star rating is the decor, tone and demeanor of the entire staff. Inside has  zero ambiance and at times it seems as if the staff is making noise to come across as an odd competition to see who could be the most pissy and vocal about it. It is entirely unnecessary to THROW silverware into a bin full of silverware and speaking loudly over it in stressed tones. Not a pleasant environment to eat such fantastic food in. If the owner likes you, you get special treatment. If not, your kind of out of luck. It's almost as if those who don;t complain get free drinks. Focus on the food instead, broiled scallops being one of their best."
1,"Winner, winner, chicken dinner! One whole chicken with lots of green sauce please! I haven't ordered take-out here in awhile but when I used to live nearby it was always a treat! Even my out of town friends and siblings crave for it!  The green sauce is key.  I usually order at least 4 extra sauces (if I remember correctly, one order of chicken comes with 1 or 2)!  If you're a rice lover like me, make some when you get home and voila! Dinner is served! Don't forget: If you're driving, bring a buddy to wait in the car or run in for you because chances are you'll have to double park!"
0,Italian food market with all the bling. Went early on a Sunday morning to beat the crowd.  Finished up with lunch and avoided the mayhem. Eataly does not disappoint!  The best of the best.  Over all $$$$ but the Cadillac always is.  Truly a class act not to be missed.
0,"This is a must! This is def not news for anyone- But this Gem in China Town is a beauty! Food is incredible - Service amazing, Design intricate and lovely. Hands down the best dumplings I have ever had ! A must for everyone !"
0,"It's like a slice of japan on 38th street! Delicious curry with all the proper toppings. A little cheesey with the ""55"" thing, and getting a seat can be hard but this is still my favorite lunch"
1,"I love Laduree and stop by every time I'm in NYC. The best macarons in the world. I love the packaging and the plethora of choices. My favorite flavors are salted caramel, choco coconut, and pistachio. The prices are borderline outrageous, but some how I justify it every time."
0,"Such a beautiful lil restaurant, amazing service and delicious food. Perfectly casual but special. Incredible vanilla pear jam, had to buy two jars for $10 each. We ordered the huge Jezebel wings, 3 to share between 2 was plenty. Prawns and grits and netty biscuit. Mini biscuit side was a great taster, had to finish off with the chocolate cake. Very memorable!"
0,Tartine is a great place to have a bite to eat.  It is a small restaurant and you feel like you're sitting at a sidewalk cafe in Paris.  I tried the French Onion Soup and Croque Monsieur.  Both were delicious.  The service was also very good.  It was a busy lunch day for them and yet they were very attentive.  I will go back for sure.
0,"Food was absolutely delicious and service was excellent ... till a mouse ran laps (literally, back and forth three times) across the restaurant floor.  It was approx 12:30 am and all the patrons that were still there were appauled - but when we spoke to the manager, his response was ""What do you expect?  This is New York City""  In the 10+ years I've lived in Manhattan, not only have I never seen vermin in a dining room, I've never seen a manager so rude in his response to patrons.  While the food was excellent, I will never go back.  Who knows what else is running around there!"
1,"FOR THE FIRST TIME I AM NOT GONA BYTCH ABOUT THE FOOD.... i mean they have  fried cheese burgers I'm SOLD! but i do have to say one thing please Korzo enough with the bands there is no room for a band. there was this lil man a foot away from me  singing god knows what in my ear and i know he was either giving me the eye or my fried cheese burger  cause he look like he was starving, but i dont need any weird hippie singing / breathing in my ear...other then that my food is always great and there vodka and cranberries always get me drunk. Brooklyn Bytch says enjoy Korzo but don't go on band night ."
1,"Hands down, the best pizza we had on our recent trip to NYC, which also included tastings at a few other places. To top it off, it was the type of joint that is run very well.  A perfect mixture of sports bar, corner drinking hole, restaurant/pizzeria, and just damn cool hang out, and somewhat surprising considering this to me felt the most ""genuine"" of all the places we visited.   Nothing was forced to fit a niche or fulfill a demographic target.  Everything was true, right on down to Bam's love of Ranger blue (and the man's not afraid to yell ""that's my boy!"" when Henrik Lundqvist makes a nice kick save) on through to the way he described his chefs pizzas... Which were truly incredible and set the bar so high that no one came close the rest of the way through our stay. But man cannot live off of wood-fired pizza alone (or at least not live a long life off of pizza alone).  Bam was courteous enough (see: doing an excellent job as a server and proprietor to up-sell) to describe a couple of their beautiful salads to us from the bar. Poor guy...  He didn't realize that we were there for the pizza and the booze...  I'm sure the salads are excellent, and can say so with near certainty because everything else that we sampled at Toby's was top notch. I sampled a couple of beers on draught- a nice Green Point IPA being the better of the two, and Aurore had a couple of massive pours of a nice Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, even trying at some point to turn away a free half-pour offered up by the hero of the night: Bam. We started our eating adventure with the Cipolla pizza, my personal favorite.  An amazing blend of mozzarella, sweet Gorgonzola, caramelized onion, fresh rosemary, and topped with some prosciutto.  The balance was perfect.  PERFECT I tell you.  I've been dreaming of this pizza since Tuesday night when I went home happy/drunk. The follow up to the Cipolla turned out to be Aurore's favorite: Smoked Pancetta pizza.  Another stellar one, this time with the aforementioned smoked Italian bacon, tomato, mozzarella, crimini mushrooms and black garlic.  That black garlic addition sets it apart from other pizzas and is the reason I can say with conviction that Toby's knows what the fuck it is doing... Pardon my language, but typing this up makes me a little frustrated knowing that I'm back in Chicago and Toby's is all the way in Brooklyn.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of great pizza places here in The Chi, but there are very few that I'd ever consider going to knowing that hockey probably will be on TV.  For Toby's I would. Thank you CC for the wonderful recommendation, and special shot out to the most accurate Iggy Pop lookalike circa '79 I think I've ever seen: Bam. Iggy's cool man...  If you hear this all the time- my apologies for being an unoriginal bastard!"
0,"My husband I just moved to the neighborhood and thought we'd give Hearth a try. Apart from the company and the cocktails (kudos to the bartender for lifting my overall rating from a 0 to a 1) it was a tawdry and particularly low-rent experience. The service was not only lacking but obnoxious (specifically the guy in dreads who was snooty and had no sense of tact) and the food honestly among the most bland and uninspired I've had. Also, who picks up the check prior to the customers leaving? Tacky. Ugh. Blah. I can't help but wonder what previous reviewers are comparing to? McDonalds?"
1,"Came here for brunch with the cousins and had a wonderful time. Great host, friendly, engaging staff and the neighborhood is very cute. The area is peppered with cute little stores and definitely made it in my 'go again' list. The food was pretty good, the french toast though very rich was mouth-watering and senses exploding kind. Definitely recommend. The green eggs were great, a little on the bland side, but healthy. I would love to come again for dinner! :)"
1,"Holy god damn shit Jane, I am in love.  I think this place could alone justify rent in SOHO.  All you need to know is that every brunch entree comes with an awesome complementary cocktail and two people can feast and drink for under $40 after tip.  Need I say more? Okay I will, Benedict Johnny, take your standard eggs benedict and make it anything but with corn pancakes, roasted tomato hollandaise and house made maple chicken sausage.  K, that should do. Go."
1,"the competition is on!  saigon bakery was just as good as i expected, if not better. as compared to banh mi so 1, here are a few observations: -the saigon bakery sandwich is slightly bigger: there is more inside and the roll is plumper -the spicy is spicy!  i love the spicy food and boy oh boy was this sandwich spicy! -same exact price, even with the ice coffee! the jury is still out, however.  i need to try nicky's before i can make a final judgement. bottom line: both saigon bakery and banh mi so 1 make an excellent banh mi!"
0,I went here last December while on vacation in New York with my boyfriend. We found this place on yelp. This place is awesome! Love their french frie dipping sauces. They let you sample it before you choose which you want too! I like the Mango Chutney.
0,"Last year after going to the Roseland Ballroom for the Halloween Bash with my friend John- we heard about this place from Jeanne's friends. (she was the one that convinced us to go to Roseland Ballroom) After leaving Roseland, Jeanne's friends offered to take us back home.  When we were in their car, they were raving to us about this place that's just a cart.  They kept on saying how good it was and we got to try it. John is such a laid back character--- he gets all excited about the food too!  So John and the rest of them ended up getting out to wait in that ridiculous line - John asked if I wanted anything.  I told him I'll pass since I wasn't hungry. The driver and I sat in the car and waited for them.  During the wait we saw two Indian guys approached this one Indian guy while he was waiting in line.  I guess these two Indians were trying to start some mess with this one Indian dude.  All of sudden that one Indian dude's friends all came out of no where.  There were about 18 of them against these two Indian fellas. I guess since they were outnumbered, these two guys ended up backing away and got into their get away rickshaw.  Yes, I said RICKSHAW---not a get away car but a damn Rickshaw. The 18 wanna be gangstas---they shouted after them while the two dudes in the Rickshaw shouted back saying they will get them soon. First of all, I found it to be HILARIOUS and Second, they are bunch of posers!  If they really wanted to do something, they could have done something - They are just bunch of children! After that a whole fiasco, they all came back into the car. John ordered this large order of the Chicken Platter and they got him so excited about the food. I swear that boy gets excited about everything - he's so crazy! They ended up taking us back to my place where John ate his food - I just had a bite from his order.  It was good, but it wasn't so freaking good like how they were describing it nor did it taste so good that I couldn't stop eating it. I ate one bite and that's it! John, who was all excited about it - was no longer excited about it anymore. He thought the same thing as me. However, I am glad that I got to try it and I enjoyed watching the show down while I waited for them."
1,This place is the best corner store in the neighborhood.  That Pho sandwich is real good.  Bacon Egg on a roll ain't bad either.
0,"Yum! This place opened my eyes to a new world of ramen - one that doesn't involve using the microwave to boil water and wait 3 mins. As a ramen novice, I can't give you a dissertation on the differences between noodle, broth types, etc. etc. - all I can say is that it's just plain good eats. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried restaurant ramen before!"
1,"This place is definitely a group place. The more the merrier. You start off with some fried eggs at your table. Not sure why, but they always cook it so well. I usually start off with the live octopus. It's something that I always have when I'm in Korea so I try to order it anytime I see it on a menu. I think the seafood hot pot is a must. This is where the group comes into play because if you try to finish between 2 people, there's going to be a lot to take home afterward. And the best part is when they make fried rice in the hop pot after your done with the contains of the of pot. I love their spicy squid/octopus stir fry in a pumpkin bowl. The pumpkin goes well with the seafood mix and slightly sweet. The best think after the meal is the cucumber water as dessert. It's so simple, yet so good."
1,"Not a bad place for Viet pho or vermicelli noodles if you are in the west village and you have a craving for it - however, you will be paying more for less food than what's you'd normally get in ctown, but then again, it is west village... They do have a cucumber drink which tastes healthy and refreshing!  Cash only establishment tho, so that's a bit annoying...."
1,"Fantastic coffee, excellent selection of alternative milks (including oat milk, even if it doesn't say so in the chalkboard menu). Their vegan bar is not a consolation prize; for non-vegans like myself, it's worth ordering for reasons of deliciousness alone."
0,"I love Five Leaves. The food is fantastic, service is attentive and fast. The only draw backs for me, and I am tall but not crazy tall, are the incredibly tight seating arrangements and the fact that the drink order always comes out when I have already had my food for a while. Somehow the bar speed doesn't catch up with the kitchen speed. Oh yeah, and why did you have to change the mushroom toast recipe? That was my favorite. That and the granola...hands down."
1,"It's probably because I'm mini not just in name but stature, but I love small plates of food so Alta's tapas are right up my alley. This place is cozy and the crowds of people waiting for a table might be a contributing factor.  Made reservations for 9 pm on a Wednesday, and still had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  The hostess was great though, and gave us sangria on the house, but I was pretty hungria by the time we were seated. I've been here several times so I'll just list out all the things I tried.  The ones asterisked are my favorites. Bacon Wrapped Dates & Olives stuffed with almonds (love the salty and sweet combination) *Fried Goat Cheese with lavender infused honey (keywords: honey and fried, what could go wrong) Crostini of House Cured Duck Breast ricotta, sundried tomato, orange, truffle honey (not very memorable, but I might have been drunk from the potent sangria) Wok Seared ""Taglierini"" of Calamari with haricot verts, garlic chips, jalapeno (it wasn't too chewy, which is something I typically dislike about calamari) *Crispy Brussels Sprouts fuji apples, crème fraiche, pistachio nuts (perfect combination of ingredients) Enormous Whole Shrimp simply grilled with sea salt (they really aren't kidding about the enormous part) Coca (Catalonian Flatbread) oven roasted mushrooms, fresh ricotta, truffled boschetto, herbs (this is a little too oily for me, I could practically see through the flatbread) Squid Ink Paella mixed shellfish, preserved lemon, guindillas peppers & scallions (this is a pretty hefty serving, you could eat this as your entree) Pan Roasted Rabbit Loin with Prosciutto tomato & olive braised leg, lemon parsnip puree (very tender) *P.E.I. Mussels harissa lobster broth, preserved lemon, cilantro (soak up the broth with bread!) Crispy Striped Bass black olive puree, pickled fennel, pumpkin seed oil, anise air, micro mesclun (anything with ""anise air"" in the description automatically wins) The Torija is my favorite dessert, it's light and the ""grapefruit air"" is a nice addition.  I don't know what my fascination with ""air"" is, since it's clearly not filling at all. Alta can get pricey, but it's a great place to go with a bunch of people when you want to share different dishes.  Message me if you ever need someone to join your Whole Shebang (you can get the whole menu for $420) outings, I'll be the one hoarding all the ""air"" dishes."
0,"This place is highly recommended for large groups. It's just a little difficult to get reservations here, hence I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. The beet salad with walnuts and ginger is delicious. The main entree that I ordered was Cacio & Pepe which is very simple but very flavorful. Service was good too!"
0,"Fun hole in the wall turns trendy because of a few celebrity sitings!  Either way, great food and atmosphere.  Just make sure you anticipate the wait!"
1,"My experience at the Bayou is one that gets better everytime my wife and I go, this past Sunday we went for Brunch, it was my birthday.   There was Live Jazz Music, and the Brunch Menu is a Powerhouse.  I had the Steak and Poached Eggs with a Blackberry Sauce and Sweet Potato Fritters, and my wife had the Shrimp and Andouille Sausage Omelette, well done all around, the Brunch Drink options, Salad or Soup, and yes, Dessert...Wake up Staten Island, the Bayou is the Move.  Our server Bridget was wonderful and professional.   Me being a Chef, I highly recommend the Bayou.  Keep up the good work.   Well done.   Neal and Maria Padilla"
1,"underwhelming.  nothing really sold me on this menu, but the whiskey selection was one of the best in cobble hill/brooklyn heights/carrol gardens.  if you're going for drinks, it's great, but i'd stay away from most of the food, unfortunately.  sub-par for the area."
1,"Some of my out of town friends and I met up here. It was a great time of intense cross conversations. The place was large and relatively spacious compared to the mess of people in times square. The food is edible- done in a Jewish deli style but none of it is high quality food. The potato pancakes- too thick to be crisp but it came with applesauce on the side. Their raspberry swirl cheesecake was little too dense but fluffy. I personally prefer a lighter cheesecake, such as Japanese cheesecake or Eileen's. We also had a carrot cake and hamburger. I like the dish of pickles that comes prior to the lunch but even the pickles were lacking. Where is the dill flavor? The rest of the food was not memorable. The only thing that I found exceptional was the wait staff. Our waiter rushed around in a crisp jacket, made us laugh and didn't roll his eyes as we split our bill a ridiculous number of ways. Would I come back? Yes- just because there is a scant amount of places to eat in times square."
1,"I LOVED everything about it. From the food to the ambiance to the people, this place is now one of my favorite restaurants in the US. After eating at per-se and the French Laundry, the food at Bouley is at par or superior to either. Add the pleasant ambiance, reasonable price and friendly staff, and this is THE restaurant to which I would go back from the three. We had the tasting menu that offers quite a bit of selection. Our server picked up quickly on each of our individual tastes from our questions and his recommendations were spot on. Starting with a wide selection of breads, each tastier than the next, we were in for a treat. Bouley has a knowledgeable sommelier that keeps the wine list superb and interesting. When the staff realized our group is comprised of ""foodies"", they added several off the menu courses for us. One of which, the venison with gnocchi, was simply phenomenal. We are all looking for another excuse to going back there again"
0,"I thought I should try this place after hearing about Michael Psilakis being the co-owner and executive chef because he has a very solid background. It did live up to my expectations but didn't necessarily blow me away. I had the sheeps milk dumplings w/tomato, sun-dried tomato, pine nuts, and spicy lamb sausage and it was delicious! The creamy and doughy dumplings played perfectly into the salty sun-dried tomatoes and spicy sausage. Definitely a dish I would order again because it was great and filled me up for less than $15. My mom had the steak with cheese and it was decent but didn't really blow me away (steak was a bit bland). And her bf had the pork loin dish which was VERY flavorful (slightly sweet and salty w/great lemon flavor and red onions which rounded it out) but also VERY small and not filling for $15. I know Greek and most European meals serve their meats by al a carte and then you order your grain as a side but their sure wasn't much meat on the plate. Our sever was extremely knowledgeable and knew exactly what to recommend for us. She was also very attentive and filled waters up promptly which is always nice. However, beware because the place is EXTREMELY noisy and it's challenging to hold a conversation without basically screaming. I don't know if the downstairs was any better but upstairs was very bad........... But if you like authentic Mediterranean food then this place will quench your craving. Didn't get a chance to try their pita bread and tatziki though, both of which I am a huge fan of. Our sever was"
1,"This was one of the rare occurrences where I wished I had been served with less food, or, to be exact, less but better-tasting food. Ordered two dishes and my party of two couldn't even finish a half. The fried calamari, unlike others recommended, didn't impress me. Instead, they tasted rather ordinary. The huge portion just made it an insurmountable task to finish. The Parmesan chicken was nicer, though it was nothing spectacular. As a family restaurant, they did keep this joint running with a friendly vibe. The service was pretty good."
1,Ridiculously long wait for Sunday brunch.  Do not come around 12pm- 2pm unless you don't mind waiting two hours in the cold.
0,"I have been going to this place for many years and I refer clients there as my business is in the neighborhood. I have probably sent hundreds of people there over the years. (I have been in SoHo for over 2 decades.) Yesterday as we were going in for the umpteenth time, I heard a lady outside refusing to go in because she felt they were rude and arrogant. I was quite surprised to hear this. We sat down and ordered but was told by an icy waiter that the salad I wanted couldn't have the asparagus it normally came with as they were out of asparagus. I said it wasn't a problem and asked for some extra avocado instead. Well...you would have thought I had asked for the world. He told me to find something else on the menu, pretty much refusing to take my order. I said I preferred the avo but he got snootier and snootier. We're talking about a $9 salad here folks...and so I asked for the manager. He sneered at me and told me it would take a long time to see the manager as he ""was too busy"" and so I got up to go to him myself but he ""got to him"" before I did and again was told there were no substitutions and if I didn't like it, I could eat somewhere else. Well we did...across the street at the ever fabulous Peep -- and let me say this, I will never eat at Il Corallo ever again, and nor will I refer the dozens of hungry tourists that seek our advice for an eatery in SoHo. Horrible, unfriendly service that doesn't deserve the loyalty of an old timer and all of his referrals."
1,"Came randomly after walking around and decided to try it.  Sat in the back which was a nice little area, could use some chairs with cushions n maybe a little more decor but still very chill.  Since the bf doesn't really eat meat we started with the mussels and fried shrimp.  The shrimp were huge n nicely breaded the accompanying sauce was tangy n just right, but they should give an even amount so those sharing can divide it evenly.  The mussels were very delicious and they gave a big portion def worth the price!  The sauce used to cook them in was tasty n the bread was a nice way to soak up more sauce.  We ordered two entrees but since the portions were huge!! We decided to just eat the catfish n spicy fries n save the shrimp linguine for another day! The catfish aka fish n chips was soooooo delicious!!!  The breading was perfect n the meat was very tender.  The tartar sauce was great with it, I'm not sure if it's homemade but it was delicious! The spicy fries were a bit too salty but with ketchup was fine!  All together it was a great meal left stuffed n happy!! I will def be going back if I'm in the neighborhood!!"
1,"Finally, after two years I get to St Anselm and the have the much hyped butcher steak ($15) which was rubbery and over-cooked. Disappointing. Everything else was good: the tomato and burrata, the spinach and mash potato. I will stick to El Almacen in the hood for a steak."
1,"Yum!!! My friend's and I had the fried catfish, porkchop, chicken wings, macaroni & cheese, okra greens and mashed potatoes. Everything was excellent. I can't say the the service is fabulous or speedy. But it was adequate and I didn't expect fast food anyway. The door guy can be a little gruff. But the food more than makes up for it. I just hope this place doesn't go the way of Sylvia's. ;)"
0,"I LOVE IT HERE!!!!! went with my bf on sat night and we had the best time. the food was amazing (crab dip with triscuits, bruscetta and DATE PUDDING!)... and heidi is the cutest person ever. we spent the whole night there talking with her and everyone else there, has such a great neighborhood feel... i feel like this is going to be my own personal Cheers!! I am so excited to go back."
1,"Stop 3 of my food tour of NY. After grabbing some ice cream, we needed another snack where we traveled up from Chinatown up to SoHo for some grilled corn.  We were kind of worried when we showed up to the main restaurant and the place was PACKED.  Thankfully they said we could get a  TO GO order next door at their more cafe like section. We walked over some twenty feet to find a crowd of people inside and out, but was easily able to find the counter to put in our order. After some 10/15 minutes we go to enjoy some corn and fries for a light snack outside on the bench.  Quite tasty, but nothing to call home about personally.  Maybe i got a smaller piece, or they don't spend the money on great corn, but i was disappointed with the size of the cob."
1,"I was sadly unimpressed with my meal at Becco.   Three of us went for pre-theater lunch.   We were ushered back to the busy back room where they pack patrons in like sardines.  After sitting for a while with no one tending to us, we had to ask for menus.  After another length of time, we realized we had to hunt a waiter down just to order drinks.  So, needless to say, the meal did not get off on a good foot.  I had high hopes for the rest of our experience, especially the food, but unfortunately things didn't get better We order Ceasar salads and shrimp for our appetizers.  Ceasar salad was ok..nothing to write home about.  For our entrees, we each had a different pasta dish.  I had the mushroom ravioli which was bland, overcooked, and with too much sauce. They are making the pasta to basically be served as ""family style"", and in doing so, take away any hope for ""fine italian fare"".  The pasta is slapped in your plate, and when it hits your tastebuds, you get to experience bland, uneventful pasta.   There are so many wonderful Italian options nearby, that I will not try Becco again.  I am really confused by all the high star reviews.  Maybe we experienced a very off day at Becco, but for me and restaurants in NYC, you get one shot, baby."
0,The pizza here is delicious! The staff were all really friendly and chatty. I felt like I was in a ski tavern while I was there! It was so cosy and lovely! I just moved to this area and I'll be visiting a lot!
0,"Worst dining experience of 2010.  I went for brunch on Labor Day and was treated to the worst service of the year.  Food took about 45 minutes to come out and our waiter was more or less nowhere to be found.  We ordered a burger and two poached eggs.  45 minutes!?  When the food arrived finally it was a buttery, salty fiasco.  Totally overrated.  The girls next to us found a hair in their french fries and had to wait about 20 minutes for a new order to arrive----and that was only after they caused a stink about the whole thing.  First and last time for Spotted Pig."
1,"I am sad to give this place two stars. I am. Let me explain. I have been to Il Corallo several times, as it is within walking distance of my work is nice for a semi-quick lunch or an after-working-late dinner. The pasta is cooked exactly as I like it, and there is soooooo much to choose from. But. I have been treated rudely twice already. That is two times too many. Most other places in NY manage to pull off al dente just as well. The first time was when I was with out-of-town friends. They wanted pasta, so naturally I thought of this great & nearby place. But when we all put cash down at the end, but server stood there, right above our heads, counting it. Then he showed me the bill and said we were short $20. We were confused. Yes, it can be confusing to do math when there are four or five people who have ordered different things and not everybody has exact change, but we couldn't have been off by that much. After much deliberation, I looked down and noticed that he didn't even take all of the money that was on the table. Boy were we annoyed and insulted. Then tonight. I was supposed to meet a friend here, and she was running late (I really love the MTA). I went to the small bar type area in the front room and asked if I could get a glass of wine while I waited. ""No,"" the guy behind the counter said. A little taken aback, I said ""I... can't have ANYTHING while I wait?"" and he vigorously nodded his head, gave me a ""didn't you hear me the first time"" look (wide eyes & raised eyebrows included) and said ""yep, that's right."" GAAAAAAAH. When my friend showed up, we went to Peep instead (directly across the street & one of my favorite restaurants). I will not be returning to this place. ever."
1,"That's a tasty burger! And its a freaking chicken burger... hot damn.  Add a little avocado for $1 and yes yes yes.   As for the fries... really good as well. The chopped salad I didn't think was great but my gf liked it so that works for me. In the sauce department, I am fine paying for sauces that are above and beyond... and these are.  I tried the chipotle mayo (standard but delicious, this is my fav overall sauce), the quince chutney (sweet and delicious), and the green hot (avocado and tomatillo meet to form a spicy delicious mofo).  I would like to see a 3 sauces for $2 deal instituted... I'll discuss next time I'm in. Also, until this place gets its liquor license... we're talking BYOB."
0,"This is a way over-due review.  I visited Cielo in January 2013 while waiting in the stand-by ticket line for 'Book of Mormon'.   The bar/restaurant is directly adjacent to the theater.  The bartenders know the meaning of the word service: prompt, efficient and personable.  Melanie and Bianca, even charged my phone for me.  During intermission, the lines at the theater were so long, I hopped back over to Cielo where I enjoyed a mid-theater cocktail.  Not quite finished with it, they held it for me til after the show.  Felt like I was in my own corner of 'Cheers' where everyone knows your name.  Thanks Ladies and staff of Cielo!  Next time I hope to have time to sample the menu."
0,"Japanese food is more than sushi !  I have been looking for a pleasant, reasonably priced restaurant that serves a variety of traditional Japanese dishes in midtown Manhattan.  Katsu-Hana, as the name implies, specializes in cutlets of pork, chicken and shrimp.  These are excellently prepared, breaded, hot, crispy and flavorful.  For a reasonable price ($21) you get soup, pickles, rice, katsu and as much shredded salad as you want.  A good variety of appetizers (Age dashi tofu, Kimpira gobo are my favorites) and quick service round out my excellent rating of this restaurant.  I left over-full and I can't wait to go back."
1,"At first I was iffy about visiting a Filipino food restaurant on my big NYC trip.  What?  Can't I get that stuff in San Diego or cooked by my own parents?  This ended up being one of my favorite foodie finds of the city. They offer some basic Filipino breakfast items and plates, such as tapsilog, longsilog, etc. and sides of bangus or pan de sal.  They also offer, and this was my favoite part, Filipino twists on more traditional American breakfasts.  I went with the Fried Chicken & Ube Waffle and I was NOT disappointed.  The chicken was fried without breading like how my dad makes it, and the ube waffle was huge and fluffy.  I also got a side of garlic fried rice and sampled some of the boyfriends Tapsilog.  Everything I ate was delicious, hearty and filling.  They even have patis and banana ketchup to go with your food! It was really quite refreshing to eat Filipino food in such a different atmosphere.  Usually for me it's either home made or from some hole in the wall point-point joint with styrofoam boxes and plastic utensils.  This place made it possible to eat that same delicious food in a lovely sit down environment, with servers who were very attentive and seemed very passionate about the place they work.  Definitely a must-try. P.S. AWESOME SOUNDTRACK.  Way to keep it old school!  Can you guys send me your playlist???"
1,"I'm probably a sucker for liking this place so much: its pricey and much of the food is easily made at home. I don't keep Paleo, but I love the idea that I can pop in and eat a filling meal knowing that the ingredients are prime without any of the snobbery of many niche-food establishments. I don't eat a lot of meat and tend to veer towards vegan/veg establishments regularly, so when I go crazy on the animal protein, I like knowing that its well sourced. I'm especially a fan of the quinoa bowls and Wrath of Rosenberg smoothie (cheers to you, Rosenberg)."
0,"Terrible experience. We walked into 3/4 full restaurant but were told we had to wait for a table. We milled around the bar for 10 minutes before being seated at a table that was empty when we first walked in. Strike one. Waited 15 minutes for our server to take our order. Strike two. Food arrived after 40 minutes, and it was ice cold. Strikes three and four. Will NEVER go back."
0,"After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, we decided to check this place out for dinner the other night.  We had high expectations.  Although the prices are cheap, the food is not good.  The meat and tortillas are too dry, the salsas are insufficiently seasoned, and the food is generally bland and not exciting."
0,"Great food, Great service, would come back here for sure!"
0,Good food--falafel sandwich is done well. Wine is also good. Good service and comfortable place.
0,"Had an amazing breakfast, especially enjoyed the homeade tater tots in the breakfast bowl, and although the atmosphere was clearly too cool for me, I never felt uncomfortable. Service was great, coffee was outstanding."
0,"I am out and out addicted to this thin crust pizza.  It is a family outing every Friday night, and if we can't make it for some reason I start having serious withdrawal issues. The pizza is amazing, and the staff has made us feel like family.  They know us, know what we want, and are very efficient even on their busiest nights.  Ron pours my beverage as I walk in, and hands it to me as I grab a seat!  The hostess and the wait staff are always cheerful.  Come on in, and enjoy the best thin slice pizza in town!"
0,Amazing food! Go!
1,"monday afternoon. still love it here and wish it could be a secret.  each time i visit i'm surrounded by germans and austrians so as they say, it must be good. the service is always what lacks most.  it's moderately attentive, but too quick and insincere.  the hostess is pleasant. lastly, if you're planning on visiting you may want to call ahead either day or night, i've come by and it was closed for private events, very disappointing as it can be a schlep to get to."
0,"Delicious personal pies and a really great selection of add-ons. Would definitely recommend the Rosso pie w/ Pineapple or the Margarita pie...prices are a little steep judging by the outwards appearance of the place, but it's 100% worth it. You can taste the difference in the high quality ingredients that they use - best pizza in Bushwick!"
1,"I was so surprised when I finally ate here two weeks ago and it didn't live up to the famous reputation. It's so popular, I thought, how could it be bad? The crust was chewy, but the stale kind of chewy, and also lacked the nice olive oil flavor I appreciate in good pizza crust. Tomato sauce and mozzarella were not as high quality as I expected. They did have Brooklyn soda in glass bottles, which was the highlight for me. Sad, I know. For good brick-oven pizza, I'd visit Numero 28 in the Village instead, any day. Two Boots is another delicious option (not brick oven) with interesting pies like my favorite, The Bird. Still haven't tried DiFara but I hear it's really the best pizza in New York. I won't be back to Grimaldi's."
1,"This place is great if you want a lot of options to accommodate several people with different tastes. They just updated their buffet with more greens (such as kale sesame salad and a kale pancake -- really delish. Btw, Woorijip means ""Our House/Our Home."" Really affordable for people on a budget."
1,"As it accompanies all places that are super hyped, I was bracing myself for some disappointment. It was a little cart at the corner of an intersection, and the line was short: only about half a block long. My friend got me a classic chicken and rice bowl, which was basically.. a bowl with chicken and rice. Nothing more nothing less, exactly what the name implies. After I got my bowl, I was instructed to a section devoted to the sauces. There was a thick white sauce, and a lighter red sauce. Do not be fooled by this ""lighter"" red sauce. It is one of the spiciest sauces I've ever put on anything ever. I think the white sauce is where the money's at for this place. It is a mayonnaise-based sauce that is simply delicious with the food in your bowl. Most people drench their bowl in this sauce, and I followed suit. I have to admit, the seemingly mediocre bowl of chicken and rice suddenly tasted unique and delicious. However, I think the bottom line is that this place depends 100% on their white sauce, while their rice and chicken is nothing special. Still not a bad deal for like 6 bucks, and they give you a lot! Overall, these places never live up to their hype, but I think Halal Guys comes pretty close. It is a place you definitely want to check out if you're in the area.

0,"This used to be a great pizza shop, now its been taken over by tourists. DiFara used to make a big New York style pizza with more upscale ingredients, now their round pie is half the size. I went here a few days ago and it was packed, pretty much all out of town tourists, took me 1 hour to get three slices. Their prices have gotten ridiculous. Its now 28 bucks for a pie that is half the size it was four years ago. This is not a good place to take a date because seating is a pain in the ass."

0,"Just came back from dinner at Chef Mark Simmon's restaurant  KIWIANA.  What a delight!  Every single thing we ordered was delicious.  The restaurant is beautiful and charming with its generous use of woods, vintage wallpaper from New Zealand and friendly + attentive staff.  This was the best meal we've eaten in a very long time.  We can't wait to go back.  Highly recommend!"
0,This is the cheers of Bushwick. Everyone knows your name. The egg sandwich is heaven. The bartenders know their stuff and the music on point.
0,"I love Sanford's. This is my favorite restaurant in Queens (and I have tried quite a few). The list of reasons that I love Sanford's is long, but here's a few: I have been coming to Sanford's since before the renovation, when it was a low key, no frills, 10-page menu typical NYC diner with great food and a friendly waitstaff who quickly learned our names. Post-renovation, the decor is lovely, the food remains delicious, the prices are reasonable, the staff remains friendly and they haven't fallen into the trap of upscaling and adopting a pretentious attitude. I think they are a prime example of what I have always loved about NYC (and is very hard to find now). The food is delicious. With rare exception (because no place is perfect), I have tried most of the dishes on the menu and you really can't go wrong. Their brunch is legendary and, what many people miss out on, is their weekday breakfast, where you can get a hot meal and a coffee for under $5 in a mellow environment - beats the bagel place down the street! Open 24 hours = a BBQ pulled pork sandwich on demand! Mmmmmmm..! Forget greasy fried eggs for your hangover cure! The waitstaff are lovely to customers both older and younger (always kind to my 4 year old nephew's antics and I very often see young parents eating there will kids of all ages). They play deep house at exactly the right volume. Com'on, what restaurant gets that right?? My only complaint is that now other people know about my favorite... er... 'secret' spot and occasionally you may have to wait a few minutes for a table. I often wonder when they are going to open an extension..."
1,"pork buns are amazing. ramen soups are also great, large portions too."
0,"I've been here many times for brunch and never been disappointed. The staff are very sweet and helpful. The food is amazing, and I've always gotten a seat immediately. Very highly recommended."
0,"I was in the mood for a bahn mi sandwich, and I came across Joju. My first impression was its a cute clean place, which is always a plus with the clean factor. We ordered the veggie ham and garden sandwich and the bbq pork with kimchi fries, my first bite and I was in love, it was so fresh, we loved the sandwiches and they were filling as well so you're not left hungry when you leave. I would def come back and bring more people who would def enjoy the experience. The drinks are also very interesting. I had the green apple and pinneapple bubble tea which was really refreshing."
0,This Hole In The Wall Is The Freaking place to be only french fries think again GO DOWNTOWN FOR THE BEST
0,"wow the food here is amazing. I think i will be back soon, those black beans though take it easy on that or else you will pass some crazy gas!!! other than that great 5 stars from me"
1,"Love this place. It's one of the few Japanese places in NY specializing in cooked food rather than sushi, and unlike the fancy kaiseki restaurants their prices are quite reasonable. I've been here several times and it's been consistently great every time. They serve impressive Japanese set meals; your main comes with various side dishes like soup, steamed egg, and pickled vegetables. The menu has a large selection ranging from grilled fish to tonkatsu to croquettes to chirashi. I usually come here for brunch and get one of the mackerel sets, although the pork tonkatsu is also very good. The anmitsu desert is one of the best Japanese desserts in NYC. The ambiance is classy and upscale, yet you'd never feel out of place there in casual clothes. It's a large space so you won't be crowded next to a neighboring table. The bar seating is spacious and an enjoyable experience, rather than being an inferior alternative to table seating like in some other restaurants.  The wait can be sometimes be long, especially around dinner time. I've never been to the one in Japan, although people have mentioned the Japanese branches are less upscale which I find quite interesting as there's a similar phenomenon where western chains like Pizza Hut open upscale branches in Asia."
1,"OMG! I died and entered pizza heaven :) Their pizza is soo delicious. On my trip to New York, I traveled here to Brooklyn with my friends and we just had to try Grimaldi's because it had such high reviews and sooo many people go here. So we went on a weekday and off peak holiday times during January. It took forever to find because since we're out of towners, the New Yorkers totally told us to go in all these different directions and I was like what in the world?!?!?! Where is this place, but then you're on hte street and you smell this savory, robust smell of... deliciousness!!! So you sort of smell your way there and you know you get closer with every step because the smell becomes more intense and makes your mouth drool. So you're there, and they seat you and it's a cute little place with a brick oven where they bake their pizzas. Love it already!"
0,Get Fresh is welcome new addition to the block. Great food and friendly service. I live in the area and there is nothing along the lines of the local and organic bent like this. When so many other places in Park Slope seem tired and just go through the motions they are priced well and whenever I go the food is prepared perfectly. The servers there are always super friendly and accommodating. They even do Whole Hog on Sundays which is worth the trip.
0,"For our anniversary, I didn't want to go too crazy. I suggested some grilled cheese or ramen, but the beau insisted on doing something a bit nicer. Applewood it was (although I'm still craving ramen). It was a Tuesday evening so they were only about half-full, which meant that the staff had plenty of opportunity to be attentive, and they were. The wine list was average, but well-rounded. The first thing that made me say ""I'm so glad we did this instead of grilled cheese"" was the bread basket, brought around by a server with a trio of homemade spreads to try with it. Both the bread and the spreads were delightful. For dinner I opted for one of the few vegetarian things on the menu (I can always count on a pasta or risotto this time of year!). My risotto was artfully presented and I thought it was really flavorful. It definitely was nicer than what I could make at home (which is how I justify spending money at $$$ places). The beau was more than pleased with his veal, an infrequent treat. When the dessert menu came around (I've read other reviews and I did note that they asked if we wanted the menus before giving them to us), it didn't take much convincing to split something. Good food, good portions, and overall a good experience. Is it a place to go on the regular? Not if you're frugal, but it's a good splurge for special occasions or a rare attempt at feeling classy."
1,The ricotta gnocchi literally changed my life. Almost two months later and I'm still thinking about it.
0,"Only ate here once, but it was great. I enjoyed the food, I got the falafel and wow it was good. Highly recommended."
1,I was having a birthday party and ordered from here.  Customer service was great.  Shredded Chicken empanadas with wheat crust and green salsa were wonderful.  Guac and chips were great.
0,great and has the spiciest food ever i love it
1,This is a hidden treasure of Astoria.  We went there by random restaurant searching when we visit museum there.  The service is great and the environment is amazing.  The food is pretty awesome.   I would go back again for their panini and hot chocolate.
0,"The paniniis served here are amazing. The menu has a nice variety of stuff that i wouldn't think of. I have been there a couple of times and the crostinis, the meat,and  the paninis are all delicious and fresh. My guilty pleasure here is their nutella hot chocolate. It is so nice to have when it is cold outside. This is a place you have to try once in your life at least."
1,"the green sauce... oh the green sauce... how I love you so.  I bought the pricey little bottle ($10!!!) and use it on anything and everything. Now the restaurant experience: cool chill place. Got a seat in the window. a little squished but good. it was hard to decide on which arepas to get. They all sounded so amazing and there are like 4veg options!  We got bloody marys that were good, but not amazing.  Plantain chips and guac on the other hand- LOVE! We got 3 of the 4 veg arepas and all were pretty gosh darn delicious!"
0,BEST ITALIAN FOOD! Chef Rocco and the staff are impeccable with their service. From the lovely ladies at the front to the kitchen is perfection. Grilled octopus and braised short ribs are a few of my favorite dishes. But theres over 30 specials so never get hooked on the menu. Love Trattoria Lincontro!
0,"Love this place. FINALLY went there after months of passing by. Owner Christina so nice to me and my 9-month old baby. And the best chicken sandwich I have ever had. Do not pass up the brownie, which is cakey and delicious. I can't wait to try to the grilled chicken and sides."
0,"Terrific, hearty Italian food in an awesome atmosphere."
0,Chicken and rice w/hot sauce was good
0,Best food ever! Will definitely go back!
0,"I love this place!  I have been going to Tavern on Jane with various friends for a number of years, and we are never disappointed.  It's quiet, low-key, and has a wonderful ambience enhanced by the old wood and unique fireplace.  The staff is always friendly and outgoing--and they provide some of the best service I have ever had in NY.  I was there recently with a friend who was celebrating a major birthday, and our server was accommodating in every way--to the point that she remembered our names throughout the evening, was always there at exactly the right time to refill our champagne glasses, and she provided excellent commentary on the menu offerings.  When the server brought the birthday dessert to my friend, she even sang ""Happy Birthday"" in key!  (Not that off-key, monotone junk that so many restaurant servers dump on their customers).  Since my friend is a professional singer, we appreciated our server's gesture VERY much.  Anyway, this was my most recent of many fantastic experiences at Tavern on Jane, and it goes without saying that my friends and I will all be going back regularly for many years to come.  If I could give them 10 stars, I would do it."
0,"Café Henry is a perfect place in Long Island City for brunch or for coffee. Their brunch items are great and tasteful. Service is very friendly and fast. Last time when I was there I tried mussels which were good. I think they serve wine and beer , I am not sure about other liquor."
0,Definitely a good sushi place. The prices are cheap if you think about the quality. The sake is cheap to. I will come back to with some friends
0,"Wow, overrated.  We went here once for a birthday celebration.  We heard amazing things about the place and we left feeling we could have had a better meal at the Olive Garden (how sad).  The food was lacking flavor, the wait stuff was awful, could not get a hold of people, we had a party of 10, and felt we were totally ignored.  The waiter actually spilled sauce on me while cleaning up and to top it off, they did not have the scotch I wanted.  Not sure why this place is rated as high as it is, but the ambiance is nice."
1,"What a disappointment!  I got there on-time with a small party of three and waited 30 minutes to be seated, blood boiling while hordes of people who came after us got prime seats.  When we were finally seated we were given a tiny table as close to the door as possible so we had to deal with gusts of cold wind every time another busload of scene-seekers showed up.  The waitress blatantly upsold the most expensive thing on the menu.  The Black Label burger wasn't all that.  Average at best.  We never got our drinks either.  The worst part was getting insulted by the waitress when I joked with her about none of us wanting us to eat the last piece of too sweet coconut cake because none of us wanted to become old maids.  She picked up the plate and said 'you should eat it'.  I guess she thought she was being funny but really, I didn't want to give her any tip after that kind of insult.  The music was way too loud.  I guess the trend of getting the privilege of bad service and paying extra for it has never quite fallen out of fashion here, even during bad economic times.  Don't waste your time."
0,"If you're tired of the standard brunches and want to try something you have never tasted before, this pop-up joint will give your mouth an experience equivalent to the first rockin' party you've ever gone to in NYC... It's pretty rad.  I will be following them wherever they go!"
1,"I've ordered from here about 3 times this recent month and have been satisfied each time! Delicious soups, wide selection and close to the office. The only downer is the its a small tiny hole in the wall, so I recommend ordering."
1,Very short menu.  Very crowded.  Plenty of wine choices.  But $300 for 4 people on Avenue C??  I dunno.  I just don't see it.
1,"I went to this place around 530pm on a Saturday, maybe one other table in the whole place. The sat me and my boyfriend at a very small table. When we asked to be moved to a bigger table to be able to order more food, they said they couldnt just incase it got busy. Sad to say, we walked out. Very unfriendly service!"
0,"JOJU!!! I am so glad this place has opened up in Elmhurst! This is what Elmhurst needs! A vietnamese sammich place! Banh Mi ftw! haha! I've been to JoJu almost everyday ever since it opened and I'm telling you, they must be putting some sort of crack in there because it is OH SO GOOD. I just can't stay away! I recommend number 2, 3, 4, and 6! #2 is their Lemongrass Chicken #3 is their BBQ Pork #4 is their Beef Bulgogi #6 is their Pork Belly Their drinks are also pretty good. If you know the neighborhood, you'll know there are many bubble tea places. JoJu's drinks are fresh! Some of their drinks are also very interesting so if you're one of those people who want to try something new, get something different rather than the usual Milk Tea! haha. I really like their Kiwi, Strawberry, and Mango Slush! Super good! Everything they make is super fresh! don't forget that!! The workers there are SUPER nice. Their kindness is overpowering!!! haha.You'll be happy that you've bought something from their store. I know I am!  :D ::edit:: JoJu now has an extended menu with a whole bunch of combination banh mi! I have two personal favorites that I really REALLY enjoy. That would be their signature banh mi, #9 - The JoJu Monster. It's a classic & bbq pork combined with a fried egg. Then there's #15 - Green Eggs & Ham. It's Vietnamese ham with two fried eggs how ever you like (I like mine runny) & special green bauss sauce! hahaha. YUM-O! Add a fried egg to any sandwich. You can get it runny, medium, well done, scrambled, or just the egg white. It definitely makes a difference and makes your sammich taste much better. I also really enjoy eating all the appetizers. I like the beef bulgogi summer roll the best. Their spring rolls are also really good. I like it with spicy sweet & sour sauce. Can't forget about their soy-garlic glaze chicken wings. There's crack in there I tell ya!!! Their Black Sesame Milkshake is a winner! The Matcha Green Tea Milkshake is really good too. My all time personal favorite drink would have to be the Strawberry Lemon Green Tea Infusion & or slush! It's so refreshing!"
0,"Me and my friend went to Arepas Cafe on the strength of reviews from Yelp. We like to try different restaurants a week and this place did not disappoint. The arepas were fresh and crisp and to my surprise very different from others I have had. I was used to the yellow corn and not the white. But the way it was prepared was definitely different and satisfying. The pernil, avocado and white cheese stuffed delight was a fave thatt I plan on venturing to again. With that, the passion fruit sangria was A-mazing. It was the exact amount of sweet with the exact amount of alcohol. The place itself is cute, a cafe that is small but  not cluttered.  The staff was friendly and our server was cool. There are tons of eateries in this area, but I'm glad I listened to Yelp reviewers on this one. Big Smile."
0,"In love with there falafel and sharma, would have given it 5 stars but they brought up the prices."
0,Great food. I love how they treat their Clinton. I came here for my launch and got hooked. So I highly recommend this place for any body that love to get good food. Yes I recommend this place.
0,"This is hands down the best Halal cart in the city. For $6 you can get chicken over rice and pita bread with crackish white sauce that will blow your mind. The food is so good you can see a line going for 2 blocks late at night. Make sure you go to the right cart as there is a cart on the same block that copies them. For the genuine stuff, check out their Facebook page for the exact locations and times they are there."
1,"I love a place that puts time and thought in to every little thing they do, and Momo does just that. I loved the 3 different variations of soy sauce, and that they mark their items with the usual V(egetarian) but even went and put a G(luten free) on their menu! I had the Yellowtail Bomb and a Salmon Herb roll. The yellowtail was super fresh and the grated daikon on top was perfectly sweet. The Salmon Herb roll was ridiculous. The cilantro and other herbs in the roll were on point. For it being a Monday it was pretty crowded and they kept making us move down every time someone would leave or come in, which was a bit annoying. But for it being affordable, delicious, and a 10 minute walk from my apartment I will definitely be back."
1,"a pretty incredible pizza experience.  yeah, you'll probably have to wait a ridiculously long time, so get over it and have a snack or something before you go. (be smarter than i was and don't go at 8:30 on a saturday night). but these little places are special, and that poor man isn't going to be around forever, so get yourself down to midwood sometime real soon."
1,"Went here for dinner on a Thursday night. We odered the pretzel (soooo good) a burger (quite tasty) and the special of the night, ribs ( yumm) its a hoppin' scene, our waitress was a pleasure & we will be going back."
1,"One of my favorite neighborhood spots. The food is always delicious and fresh. Had my birthday dinner here recently and although they were a bit late to seat our reservation, they certainly made up for it with great service and wine."
1,"Extra spicy ramen - do it! Broth isn't overpowering and I didn't feel thirsty after! Portions are just perfect as well. I find that when I go to Ippudo I can never finish a whole bowl of ramen, and I often feel bad wasting the rest. But I finished it here and I felt fine after! I went during labor day - went there at 5pm sharp and there was already a line. Unfortunately we had to wait 30 minutes because the first wave of people already filled the space. But it was worth the wait! I would recommend getting there by 4:45 to put your name on the list."
0,"Delicious! I went to the city to see the tree and we stopped in for a bite to eat. The spinach dip was divine, the prosciutto in the panini was fabulous and I definitely enjoyed the lava chocolate cake! Of course you can't forget the wine! I live in New Jersey and I would definitely make a trip back - from the ambience to the service, what a perfect place to bring a date!"
1,"BEST... ITALIAN... LINGUINE... PERIOD! Plus the service was excellent.  Even though the size of the restaurant is extremely large, it's always crowded because they're located in the heart of Time Square. But please come for the linguine.  It was definitely the best linguine I have ever had.  Also, they are a family style restaurant so order a few more plates to share."
0,service is amazing  good yummyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
0,Veal Parm looks like a ping pong paddle but I've never had better. Redonkulous. It's so good
1,"Let's be clear -- Fukurou still serves top notch food -- see my first review. Since my last visit some time ago, recent changes have left me disappointed (as one of their earliest reviewers, and ardent supporters mind you). Walked in tonight alone to find the bar area full, but was kept standing and prevented from sitting at the two-seater tables, until the senior staff gave the waitress the go ahead. Picked the small corner table, only to be told CURTLY to move to an even tinier table -- this despite 5 other large tables being empty (in a restaurant with ~12 tables). Bad start. Ordered my usual food, only to be told very curtly again that I MUST ORDER A DRINK. Expressed surprise at this change (yes I've been away), and only received a flippant ""just order something!"". I'm clearly not the only loyal customer who's been put off by this new rule, see other reviews. Food was then shoved in unceremoniously at my elbow without a polite ""excuse me"" (this in a Japanese establishment mind you) and the rice mixed sloppily and roughly, much unlike what I had experienced many times before. I'll stop complaining here -- the food was great as always. The culprit seems to be the waitress on duty (with spiked earrings tonight). I noted a distinct difference in attitude when interacting with potential big tipping tables -- i.e. alcohol, suits, etc.. Service aside, the new one drink minimum is grating, and takes away much of what I found charming about Fukurou in the first place. It seems they have finally built their base of Japanese salarymen clientele (yes it's an izakaya) and let their guard down. ""Japanese"" is often a synonym for near-perfection especially in dining, and letting such third-world standards of service tarnish their reputation is disappointing."
0,"Excellent! First of all: This is NOT a date place.  Unless your date likes small, non-descript restaurants with 14 seats, half at a counter, that is. If you're looking for absoutely delicious homemade noodles and dumplings for cheap cheap cheap, this is the place to go. My roomie Sarah and I went tonight, got seats right away, and had our food delivered to us in about 5 minutes. It's easy to get to, half a block from the F stop at E. Broadway.  She got the oxtail noodle soup and I got the fried pork noodle soup. We each got a soda and an order of boiled dumplings. Grand total: $17.50. Nice! Everything tasted great and it was fun to watch the staff make the noodles right in the dining room. There are many condiments on the tables, but I recommend the vinegar -- there's something about it that makes the noodles SING. Trust me: Go tomorrow.  Better yet, go tonight. Or right now. Who doesn't like late night Chinese?"
0,REVISION Dinosaur BBQ  cares about its customers. I received a call and they wanted to make it right I do love the Fried Green Tomatoes thank you very much I was there yesterday and I was not impressed one of the items I ordered the mild chicken wings and when I got them home and started eating them they were hot i called the restaurant because I thought it was a mistake and the response I got was not helpful I will not recommend or will I ever go back.  A little customer service goes a long way.
0,The best Italian restaurant near Times Square. Had lunch and dinner so many times but never disappointed. The Chef has some touch. Other than good pasta dishes the ones that need special mention are Shrimp and Salmon Oreganato Flounder on Spinach And don't forget their Sangrilla
1,"Restaurants that don't take reservations give me anxiety. Knowing that you have to get somewhere at just the right time so you don't end up waiting over an hour (any wait over an hour to eat is ridiculous, and just means that your service sucks and is inefficient) is a bit annoying and you're basically taking a gamble and would likely need to plan a backup... Anyhoo... I arrived at Friedman's at 11:15am on a Sunday (Easter) so I figured it was a 50/50 chance that it'd be hella busy or not. It was definitely bustling inside with a handful of people waiting outside. I inquired about a table for 2, and the hostess said it'd be a 45 to 1 hour wait. Since my friend hadn't arrived yet, I figured it was fine and waited outside. We were seated around 11:50am, so it wasn't too bad of a wait. Specials for the day were Apple Cinnamon pancakes or Crab Cake benedict. I wanted both, but ended up with the crab cake benedict. It was great. They give you pretty good sized crab cakes with a perfectly poached runny egg. There was also sauteed spinach, but I wished they had used baby spinach instead bc you get that grassy feeling after awhile and I couldn't eat anymore spinach. Friend had the Lamb Burger, and while I'm not a huge fan of lamb because of the gaminess, the burger was not too gamy. The herb fries were awesome. We also had  side order of biscuits and jam. The biscuits were a little on the dry side but with a salted butter taste to it. I preferred the apple cinnamon butter it was served with rather than the housemade raspberry jam. Overall, its a decent place. I like the ambiance and decor. I didn't like the wait so much, but hey, it's Sunday and everyone brunches on Sunday. It's in a great location for people who are heading over to MSG or waiting for a bus or train... I recommend it."
1,"My boyfriend bought me to this popular little spot in the west village. This place is more popular during spring or summer because people stand around or sit outside on those 2 chairs and eat their fries. Anywho the best part about these fries are their sauce!!!!!! Hands down the best sauces ever, must try the mango chutnay!!!! We come back occasionally if we eat around the area."
1,"The best macarons I've had, ever. The shells were soft and the flavors intense. I'm sure all the flavors are fantastic so go with whatever appeals to you. I will comment on my experience in detail, though. There was a line outside of the store on Saturday afternoon, and it seems like the store is bottlenecked by the lone cashier who seems to operate rather inefficiently. Just sayin'!"
0,$5 a slice.  Forty minute wait at 3:00 p.m.  Two burnt slices. Very disappointed.
1,a surprisingly large and ambitious menu only concern is it can seem like a high-end diner with mediocre wait service the timing of items we're off (served ceviche with our seared scallops / beef tartare with our entree) which is something that would be fixed with an attentive wait staff the decor is beautiful and the food is on point it's casual atmosphere EDIT: why is there a TV in this restaurant? thats pretty tacky -
1,"My vote for best Old Fashioned in New York. The duck and oysters don't disappoint, either. So sad that Rye is hidden away; it totally kicks Walter Foods over the barrel."
0,"We were in the mood for Italian food...this place popped up so we gave it a chance. The food, atmosphere and service was 5 star. Really great. The Papardelle with short rib ragu was outstanding. We had 4 other dishes and each was equally impressive. A must visit. You won't be disappointed."
0,"Member of the miditto Sunset Wine & Dine Meetup which took place there midweek.  Lively group that was friendly, conversational and well-traveled.  Sampled several wine and prosecco, all of which were terrific, in particular the house red wines, which were full-bodied and pleasant.  I tried the Taramasalata spread, a red caviar with olive oil and lemon that was strong on its own, but nice as a spread with the various breads provided.  Two raves near me for the grilled octopus.  Service was excellent; never a need for waitstaff.  Cozy interior with a nice ambiance."
1,"I had the sum tom avocado and grilled chicken kidney skewers. It was indefinitely the worst meal of my life. The chicken kidney tasted like charcoal, it was so burnt you couldn't taste anything. The sum tom avocado salad was horrible, not only was it spicy in a bad way, there was barely anything worth while in it except the avocado.."
1,"Arriving just before 11am, we were able to skip the line, and had some delicious ramen at this popular NY ramen spot. With a clean, modern black and white interior, jazz music plays in the background which sets the tone for a carefree, relaxing meal. Highly recommended by reviews and friends, we ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen. The 'original' Tonkotsu soup noodles with Ippudo's secret ""Umami Dama"" miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil. Secret miso paste?! Now that has got to be good. And it was. The soup was flavourful yet not too salty. The noodles were less chewy than what I'm normally used to, and the other ingredients were all delicately prepared. This was a complex bowl of soup noodles. We also ordered the pork Hirata Buns. Soft slightly sweet steamed buns filled with tender pork with Ippudo's original spicy buns sauce. Like a delicious mini sandwich, this is a dish that has to be ordered. They have amazing service. Each person had a specific role. Water was refilled almost every time I took a sip. Food was brought by one person, the bill brought by another. It's like they have perfected the most efficient restaurant service ever. Guess a place with 3000+ reviews better have some sort of system implemented. Try to go in the off hours, and you're guaranteed for one of the best ramen experiences ever."
0,"This place is amazing! I had a fantastic time, everything was fantastic. From the food and the service. it can be pretty loud, but it makes it lively and it's a good busy restaurant, so it's too be expected."
1,"One word: DELICIOUS!! Everything is spiced correctly, fresh, and the perfect crunch. I love it!"
1,"After hearing many good things about the restaurant, the preparations for coming here during the restaurant week had to be quite intricate: the reservations for the first day of RW sold out within 10 minutes. We made it the second day. The service was friendly and efficient, perhaps the best I have experienced, the ambient in the dining room was very pleasant without showing off.  The waiter seemed well-informed, so I trusted him with making my wine pairing. The ciapatta (which incidentally means slipper in Italian) was delicious, the sourdough was a bit burned. My appetizer was a mix of calamari, carrots, pine nuts, caviar with lemon juice: when I managed to get a pine nut along with the rest, the taste was very nicely balanced, but there were not enough pine nuts. I also tasted risotto with mushrooms, but I found the risotto a bit watery. In all, very good but it didn't make me smile. The main course was an interesting pork croquet on a bed of vegetables and cheese. Just after my first bite, our super-waiter showed up with the wine - some of the best pinot noir I've had, quite worth its $14. The croquet was very good, but it only made me smile along with the wine. I tried a bit of roast lamb, and it was very delicious. Time for deserts: the chocolate-hazelnut mousse was pure amazing perfection. I also enjoyed light airy quarkcake with blueberries (quark is the Germanic type of farmer's cheese) on a delightful light plate of pastry. In summary, for this price range (expensive but not splurgy): five plus star service, five star deserts and four star food. I was very impressed. The bill came with the dining certificates, and my smile turned to a grin (outside). Gramercy Tavern was by far my best restaurant week experience. Hoooray for them, and I'll be back soon."
0,"Breakfast and lunch at this cafe is wonderful.  I can't say enough wonderful things about their menu.  Service is good, average.  Atmosphere is so-so.  But I come here for the food period."
1,"I visited new york and found this restauran on yelp.  the food there was amazing, but the chocolate souffle was HEAVEN!  :)  I highly recommend this reccomend this restaurant."
0,"Best ramen in New York! The desserts are amazing! Even if you have to wait one hour before to sit, it's totally worth it!"
1,"Best place!!! The best R'n'B and Hip Hop on the stereo and the best meatballs and sides ever. Everything is nicely down to earth and everyone is having a great time. Tried almost all different types of servings, except for the desserts and sandwiches. The regular beef with spicy sauce is just amazing! Make sure you go!"
1,"Really great pizza. Huge place. Only problem is the wait and expect a long one. I put my name down and had to wait an hour and 1/2! Luckily I had some friends who were hanging out at a bar nearby, so I just waited there, but that's one hell of a wait. There is a bar in the restaurant itself if you want to wait there as well. Also, it was a bit pricey. But, at least the pizza was great at least."
1,TATER HEAVEN! Don't get it delivered - portion size is much smaller. Deal with the wait on the weekends and you'll be happy you did. This bowl is a seriously large bowl filled with all of your dreams.
0,The food is great but the wait is long.  So get there early to get your name on the list and then make plans for the next hour or two.  The great thing is that they txt you when your table is ready.
0,what are all the stars for........food is not all that great...service with all the kids as waiters.......and the sangria even though you could say cheap! is not even worth it which is like water. the times i have been there they didn't have margaritas-and i've been there 3 times to try out diffrnt dishes with my buddy we just try the food for flavor and decor. and the bathroom with a hole next to the window....eeewwwww!!!!!!!!!.......eeeeek! me-thinks-not. but that's just my 2 cents.....and i'm a cook in the city came all this way to see the hype-ill stop by some other local ones....
1,"Over the past few years, my wife and I have had a number of wonderful meals at Juventino. It was ""Get Fresh"" when we started going, and the quality and service have been consistently good since the change and throughout. The meals have ranged from a romantic dinner for two outside, to a peppy brunch with family, to a friendly dinner with a large table of companions. This is not the least expensive restaurant, but I would say the food, ambiance, and service more than justify it. I have definitely paid more for far lesser meals around the slope.  A couple dish highlights from various meals: Baked Eggs: Unbelievable. I have been trying to replicate these at home, sadly to mixed results. This is one of those things that sticks in your mind. Perfectly delicious Bruleed Vanilla Sugar Grapefruit: Last time we went, I think they didn't have it any more. I hope they've brought it back, or will in the future! Surf and Turf: Just fantastic, and quite frankly, something of a bargain, given the quality of dish. Berkshire Pork Loin: Nicely done piece of pork, with some lovely accompaniments. This is the type of place that makes me sad to be leaving New York, but happy that I have somewhere to return to on the special occasion that I return. I will be more than happy to bring people to Juventino in the future, for a nice surprise worth leaving Manhattan."
0,Excellent Food
0,I am very happy when I come here their service is amazing and I love coming here for brunch. Overall very pleased with the service
0,Cool Cool!! Someone makes the trip to Maine for my favorite snack and its actually fresh!! The prices are good and its local and totaly in the red hook spirit. I love small business like this. Keep it going lobter dude we love you!!!
1,"I had dinner at Givanni's on friday night ,and i must say the food was awesome!! I had a veal saltibocca that was to die for. the staff is really nice and courtious with a goal to make your night as comfortable as possible. oh....and try the mussels marinara (red sauce), I thought I was on coast of Amalfi , thats how good they were. Try Giovanni's and I garantee you that you'll be an instant fan of this little eatery."
0,"Steps away from NY Public Library and a quick walk from Time Square.  An order includes two two small wraps (burrito like), can be of two different varieties.  May take a while to place a order if there is a line but can call in, and they can be eaten in hand. It's a marvelous alternative to the unhealthy and expensive portions of the tourist -trap restaurants.  The place is smallish but has a few tables.  Or you can take a short walk to One Bryant Park 6th Ave btw 42/43rd (3rd tallest building in NY), awesome space if it's not crowded for lunch time."
0,"Always go for the classic, #9 Monster, lemongrass chicken, or the pork. Can't go wrong with any of them. Super flavorful, nice pickled carrots and daikon, great sandwich sauce, and crisp fresh cucumbers. Try it with a sunny side egg cooked to your liking (runny, medium, well done). The sandwiches are so good that they are even better the day after absorbing all the sauce and flavors."
1,"Service was good. Manager was rude and disorganized about reservations and food order. Fried oysters, fish with soba noodles, and scallops were ok. My companion had a fly in her drink.  They didn't even comp her drink. My companion ended up with food poisoning from eating her food."
1,"Great food and friendly owner.  I've never been there when the amiable owner hasn't come around to say hello, even when they're swamped.  There is generally a wait of course, but it's well worth it.  The owner will often bring out complementarity slices for those waiting for a table."
1,"Starving me and a boyfriend who wants to fill my appetite quickly - we scurried out to Alphabet City to check this place out.   He had once or twice been here but it was my first time so... Service was good but a little disappointed that this place was not as well ventilated as I expected most places to be on a hot summer day.  The workers all situate themselves out in the dining area - chattering.  It's fine by me as long as my food doesn't take 20 minutes to make.  AND it was just a Cubano.  AND it barely looked like it had anything in there.  SMH.  Luck for them I guess, I have a ""small"" stomach.   My boyfriend's food came after mine and it was just a plate of cut out pernil as supposed to stredded, a plate of spanish rice and a cup of red beans.  It was good but not as fulfilling as he wanted it to be either and not as he remembered it used to be. Food is cheap and good but not to the point where I'd recommend going if you have an appetite.  I'd rather go to La Isla instead.  Sadly La Isla on Delancey doesn't stay open after 6pm.  SAD FACE."
1,"This place is really cute. I went to Spain 3 years ago and have been missing their tapas. This restaurant was really great and reminded me of the tapas there! The sandwiches are very small, about the size of an iPhone priced from $1 to $2.50. I ate sandwiches with salami, salmon, and chorizo. I definitely recommend anything with salami and chorizo. The salami tastes like regular salami, not bad but not impressive. No matter what dish you order, you get free french fries, which were just ok.   I drank white sangria, which had a weak alcoholic taste to it and lots of Sprite. I don't like strong alcohol in general, so this suited me well. They didn't card me, which was a little disappointing because I recently turned 21 and wanted the chance to show my ID haha. My only complaint about the food is that the bread is kinda hard and made the roof of my mouth hurt, like when you eat too much chips or Apple Jacks cereal. I only ate 3 sandwiches; it started hurting during the second sandwich. Tip: Find a table before you order because the place is small and you don't want to be without a table when your food is ready. Alternatively, you can order take out. Overall, the experience was exciting and the portions are wonderfully small, so there's no pressure to overeat. I would definitely come here again and try their other 97 sandwiches!"
0,"Yuca Bar is a great place for tapas, dinner and drinks. I have been here a few times already and everytime has been excellent!! I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for good food and great service!"
1,I finally found pho love in NYC. Tried the shrimp summer rolls and the beef pho. Both were light and flavorful. I would recommend both.
1,"Zoinks. This is going to hurt... My favorite dish on the menu, which I've order again and again, is wildly and unbelievably inconsistent. Pigs Head Torchon. The first time I ordered it, I was off the wall with excitement and glee, priced at 19 dollars. Two big circles of amazing fried goodness. Then the price went up a dollar. Then each circle got smaller. Then the price went up a dollar. Then each circle got smaller. Then the price went up a dollar. Then each circle got smaller. That's just the way of the world. And though I can accept this, I honestly feel that the quality of the ingredients going into the product (HOW DIFFICULT CAN IT BE, when you're talking about the cheapest and generally least desirable cuts from a pig) are increasingly inferior... And then they took Lamb Belly off the menu... The way they serve beef tendon, to me, seems almost disgraceful. It seems treated in such a way and presented in such a way that it will never remind one of something undesirable... (DUMBED DOWN).. And, to be honest, it's an acquired taste/texture, which is part of the adventure... And then there's the super-overpriced bread and butter. In my humble opinion, better bread and better butter are given for free elsewhere... I've had pretty much everything here, again and again... The ""buns"" are delicious, but again inconsistent. One person will get what seems like three times as much meat (sometimes I'm that person, sometimes I'm not that person)... Sometimes the Hamachi is blindingly beautiful, and sometimes it's just plane bland... I've had the shortribs twice. After the first couple bites I always have to drown them in Sriracha to get any actual flavor... I've had the Manila clams twice and have been let down both times (one time I was served three unopened clams, a big no-no. the other time the bacon segments were completely undercooked).... Once I ordered the sweetbreads, another time a friend ordered the sweetbreads, and I thought they were terrible both times (whenever I see sweetbreads on a menu I order them, so I know what I like)... The three terrine sandwich was alright, I guess.. And, lastly, the kimchi (which is, according to what I understand of ""tradition"" is a part of the ""welcoming/gracious"" gifts from proprietor to patron) is just alright -- I've had many different versions, at varying levels of spice and tartness, but this one (which is not cheap) is just OK... Honestly, my opinion of this place is: They're trying to dumb-down the food--which is entirely understandable, they're trying to introduce what to most people are, let's just say, ""unfriendly"" ingredients, but in such a way that all integrity and identity are completely sublimated. It's pretty much like battering and deep-frying everything, except in the opposite direction. Let's just take all the flavor out of everything. Let's separate everything from everything else and charge for each individual part... And they're afraid of putting any actual spice into anything... To me it's like trying to do something like ""Jean-Georges"" without understanding exactly what they're doing... It's like they have no self-confidence, or no confidence in their ingredients, or no confidence in their clientelle... I could go on and on."
1,"One afternoon, my friend and I were starving and decided we wanted Mexican.  We yelped a good spot in Queens and ended up at this hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  I was skeptical at first, but we took one look at the menu and wanted to beg them to let us order breakfast.  It was too late though, so we settled for half the appetizer menu.   We started with guacamole and continued on with chorizo topped nachos that were out of this world.  Then came fresh queso tamales (though they had other options), quesadillas and tacos filled with pork and pineapple and steak.  At this point we were ready to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we had to press on and order dessert and it was no easy feat.  Tres des leches topped with fresh mango and fresh whip cream.  I don't think either of us put down our fork. I only am giving it three stars though because the place is tiny and the service is ridiculously slow.  If you need a quick bite, forget it.  At one point I thought our waiter had gone to the farm to get a cow to milk for queso and shuck corn.  Seriously.  I happened to be facing a window where I watched him carry out a bench with some construction worker.  I'm not really sure what goes on in the kitchen, but the food is definitely worth the wait if you've got time to spare."
0,"This is my mecca for good food. Love the fish, love the appetizers, love the outdoor seating during the summer. I am yet to find a thing to criticize about this place. They do not take reservations so you would have to be patient with long waiting times (up to 2 hrs on a busy night) but it is definitely worth it. Go grab a drink in one of the nearby bars or pubs (e.g. 718). I crave this place if I don't eat there for a couple of weeks or so."
1,Caramelized onion and goat cheese pizza. It was sensational. I make it at home now but not as good.  It's well worth the visit if you're near Washington square park.
0,"We will never come here again... This place is not kid-friendly!  Long story short, we had a very odd and negative experience with a bus boy and subsequently a low level manager named Josh, who clearly have very low tolerance for kids!  It was unlike anything I've ever experienced!  The waitress was even surprised and really wanted to get a higher manager involved but we simply didn't want our entire meal with friends consumed by the drama.   I have never reviewed anything on yelp, but really felt the need to warn fellow parents!  Go elsewhere!  There are so many fabulous, kid-friendly restaurants in the hood, and the food here is mediocre, at best.  I know that when we are craving BBQ, we will be sticking with Home Town!"
1,"Visiting from the west coast, wanted to get some sushi and found this place near where I was staying. Phenomenal! My cous and I were seated right away, the waiter was really wonderful and attentive but playful at the same time! He definitely made the experience significantly better for me. The environment was also really cool, quiet, trendy, and clean! Like with most eating places I visited during my stay, it was a gold mine! Ordinary on the outside but really nice once you enter! Pretty small and intimate restaurant, which I think would make it nice for a date. We ordered sake, sadly they had no sake bombs :( I was worried since I've never had good smooth sake...but I was pleasantly surprised! Whatever sake they served was super smooth, and I didn't mind that my cousin tricked me into drinking more shots than her. The waiter also hooked us up with a free refill on sake because we enjoyed it so much, what a cool dude! :) The food, I don't remember what I ordered exactly but I got a bunch of delicious rolls and sashimi. Never been a fan of sashimi also, but whatever garnish and sauce they drizzled on their sashimi really did the job for me. I thoroughly enjoyed all the food there! Also our bill came out to be surprisingly cheap because we made it during happy hour. What a happy hour it was :)"
0,"Totally mediocre.  This was my third attempt at brunch.  The first two times, I thought that I must have gotten the wrong thing.  This time, I blame them.  Got a curry chicken salad sandwich with fries.  I make roast chicken at home quite a bit, and make chicken salad with the leftover bits.  It's a way to make sure that nothing goes to waste.  Good when I do it at home, but for $14 at a restaurant, they need to give you the prime meat, not the left over gristle and bits of wing meat they didn't serve last night.  But that's just what this was == bathed in a salty mayo with an oil slick of tinned Thai curry hanging out in only one corner of the pita.  I looked at the plate thinking, they charge money for this?  Fries were okay, but not as good as the average diner.  I'd give it one star, but the server was nice, and the place is pleasant inside even if we were jammed up against the next table."
0,"Delicious foods! The menu was very good, taste was was so good and their prices was very good too. Were enjoyed the moment in this place especially their foods."
0,One of my favorite places in Astoria.  A lot of great places to eat on 31st ave.  Il Bambino has great food.  Sitting outside is a must.  Very nice outdoor seating.
1,"utterly fantasic restaurant.  Great, informal atmosphere, attentive and smart staff, and phenomenal food.  can't say enough about theplace.  Pricey, but unlike so many other restaurants, totally worth the splurge."
0,"The good was tasty, wine list decent for the size of the restaurant. The service? Awful. First of all, my husband and I were seated in the WORST section. I don't mean location-wise, I mean staff-wise. Our server (if you go, she has long fake blonde hair and looks scary skinny, almost like the crypt keeper) was the rudest, most inconsiderate and short-tempered woman I've ever met that works in the service industry. She rolled her eyes at my husband's questions (as she turned her back to walk away, so I think she thinks we didn't see her), didn't smile once, and acted like we were idiots the entire time she spoke to us. At one point, I heard her talking badly about another server! I understand the restaurant industry is probably very frustrating, but I don't want to hear about your problems, I want to enjoy my meal. Another server, who wasn't ours and didn't deal directly with us, was very immature. I think she may play a more vital role in the restaurant than just as a waitress, because many other customers seemed to recognize her and talk to her. The problem was she came across as very juvenile... she would constantly giggle behind her hand to the bartender or hostess, and acted like she always had some hilarious secret to tell. I understand she's young and likes to have fun, but there's a time and place to act like it, and working in a restaurant is not that time or place. Her actions made me feel like I was back in middle school being judged by the cool kids. Also, she played with her hair a LOT. It seemed it was always in a different style every time I saw her... that cannot be sanitary. If my husband and I choose to eat here again, it will probably be delivery. We don't want to deal with the awful staff again."
1,"Kensington and Prospect Park South have a major DEFICIT. It's impossible to find a decent fucking sandwich that elevates beyond the common deli faire. ENTER: Brancaccio's. With some freaking amazing quality sandwiches. Good bread, great meats, and quickly made. There's a somewhat daunting list of options when you first walk in....but seriously, every sandwich is pretty awesome. The Tuna with Prosciutto is great, so is the Egg Ham, Cheese and Tomato on Ciabatta. And don't forget to pick up one of their Prosciutto Bread loafs. Seriously, this place is a breath of fresh air, with some amazing food and a fun atmosphere, go grab a sandwich. Important fact though: There's no seating here, so head to the park to chow down!"
1,"My review is based on a recent dinner at Clinton St. Baking Co., and is in no way a reflection of their brunch, which I vaguely remember as being awesome, but that was awhile ago because I'm now old and have no patience to wait for food. Upon arriving on a random weekday, there were no other patrons in the restaurant. At least we were seated right away. I ordered the crab cakes and a side of onion rings, hubby got the BLT with fried shrimp for an app. The BLT was pretty good with avocado and nice thick bacon. But the rest was, obviously fried but greasy and flavorless. My crab cakes were also fried, which I should have asked, but I was not a fan. They were 2 small balls of fried crab on top of a HUGE pile of thick cut sweet potato fries. I guess I was expecting more from a place that is know for great comfort american food. I was expecting flavor. Maybe I'll be back for brunch again...maybe not..."
0,Perfect. Alexis was our waitress along with Stephanie who was training . They were very helpful in making menu choices. The drinks from the bar are very good.The bus boys were very helpful and attentive to us. The food was absolutely great. The view was is beautiful !
0,"Have been there several times and it rocks! I give 5 stars because of the value. Very tasty little sliders,  beers, and shakes for super cheap. You will leave happy. I emphasize value;  if you're looking for crazy gourmet burgers, this is not the place - but I love it!"
0,"I'm a die hard fan of the spotted pig.  Easy joint to pick up single NYC girls, lo! :)   Besides the awesome burgers and shoestring fries, you'll find the A-okay looking girls hanging out here, waiting for Mr. Right to come along her way.   But a great pub to strike up a conversations and see where it goes....."
1,"Swung by Vanessa's Dumpling House last weekend to see what the hype was all about.  After quickly looking at the menu I first thought that it was priced ""per"" dumpling.  Nope, Chive and Pork Fried Dumplings, five for a buck!  Holy s#!@ did I really just find one of the last few deals in NYC?   We also had the Peking Duck Sesame Sandwich, the price was right and it was very tasty. Some of the dumplings we had were a bit on the greasy side but I am not about to complain for the price.  Don't expect to grab any seats here, you can maybe hope to get a standing spot at the window.  Will definitely be back to Vanessa's to explore some other menu items."
0,"We've been there several times just for coffee, which is a bit expensive but they brew it individually so it's always fresh. Coffee can range from $2.50 to $3.25 (just coffee, no espresso drinks) but are worth it once in a while. So given the vibe of the place and yes, the music selection is good we decided to give the food a try. Great idea gone bad... My husband ordered the gouda, we both liked it but it is NOT enough food for the price ($10), it comes with a side of salad, a very small one. And I ordered the open face focaccia with ajvar and feta cheese and it was just two pieces of bread with a spread of ajvar (so faint that I could hardly taste it) and sprinkled with feta cheese ($10), so basically I paid 10 dollars for just bread.... we spent $30 at the place, left still hungry and went somewhere else to have the rest of our dinner. I get the idea of making something simple fancy but it HAS to taste great. We felt ripped off, it was way overpriced. Not going back."
1,Great food service and vibe. Chefs tasting menu is no brainer.
1,"We sat in the bar and shared the olive-oil poached halibut with spring pea stew (light and delicious), and that god damned amazing half chicken (so simple--just black pepper & pickled chili). Some creative cocktails (thanks for the pickled asparagus spear, bartender), but these 5 stars are for the chicken alone."
0,"I should have run the other way once I set foot inside the door, but I had 4 family members with me for an impromptu lunch, and it was freezing outside!  Although the place was 1/2 empty, we were greeted by sour-faced hostess who made it clear we were imposing on her rigorous schedule of standing around and chatting with the waitress. The food was OK, mostly unmemorable.  (You can find better tapas in the city.)  Dishes came out VERY slowly, and we had a tough time flagging down a waitress to complain, because she was so busy catching up on gossip.  It's alarming that we couldn't gain anyone's attention, given that the restaurant is roughly the size of a shoebox! Poor service and a lack of attention to basic needs (like water, or utensils for example) really bothers me when you are paying for a meal.  So I stepped to the back of the room and asked to speak with the hostess/acting manager.  I explained that I was disappointed with our long wait for food and the inattentive waitstaff.  She stared blankly at me...and had almost no response or reaction.  It was maddeningly unhelpful, and we all walked out of there commenting about what a bad dining experience it had been.   I would definitely not return, and would not recommend this place to friends."
0,So disappointed! Recommended by U of C friend of my son's.It was supposed to be a special treat. Chicken overcooked and greasy. Service terrible .Room manager was very rude. Young manager the restaurant  was sweet and almost. Try Sylvias in tears because other girls were giving her so much difficulty
0,"We loved the experience at ""Beyond Sushi"". This place offers tasty food at a reasonable price. Our new favourite vegan Restaurant in NYC"
1,"I eat Indian food ALL the time in Manhattan mainly. There hasn't been anything in the Flatbush/Ditmas Park area that I thought was decent for YEARS, but I finally signed up for Seamless Web to see if there were any new delivery options in this area besides the atrocious Picket Fence. I notice that there was a new Indian restaurant called Gandhi/Agra Classic and I decided to take a chance.  Most of the Pakistani restaurants on Coney Island Ave. and the Bangladeshi places over in Kensington have all been very disappointing but THIS place was amazing.  I have never dined in but as you can see in their photos the restaurant looks fairly nice compared to all the Caribbean hole-in-the-walls here.  The food is always consistently great, the delivery is timely, and the food portions are great.  I usually use Seamless Web to order from them but there's been times when it didn't work and I had to call them directly.  They are very friendly on the phone and I always use those times to compliment them on how much I love their food (I really really do!)  To be fair, I'm pretty consistent in my order. I always get the Chicken Vindaloo (cuz I love it hot) and I get a side of naan or two.  I've tried some of their appetizers like the samosas (delicious) and one night for fun I decided to try the Chicken Liver Poori because there was an article written about it in the Village Voice. Read about it here: blogs.villagevoice.com/f… If you live in the hood and you want something different and delicious, please give them a try. Now is the time to support your small business owners and stop calling Papa John's."
1,"I would consider myself very much a meat eater, but if I had to become vegetarian I think I could live off Taim Falafel & Smoothie Bar. Taim has two items in it's name: ""Falafel"" where all three options are superb, and ""Smoothies"" - where I haven't been able to make a bad choice either. I wouldn't recommend the venue for eat-in as it's just too small, but as a to-go venue the rest of the revues on Yelp are very accurate in terms of how great Taim is."
0,"Heard it was worth walking a few blocks out of our way for, and we heard right! Very tiny place (walked past it once before finding it), a well-stocked baked goods counter, and excellent coffee."
1,The BEST macarons EVER! The cookie shell is so soft & the centers are so perfectly blended. These aren't your typical macarons. Not overly heavy or sweet either. Cute little boutique in the Upper East Side. Staff is very accommodating & patient. Definitely worth the wait! & DEFINITELY coming back!
1,"The environment is great and inviting, but I was a bit disappointed about the food. The steak empanadas are great, but the chicken is just okay. The Mexican chorizo arepa is good, but I recommend the Colombian chorizo on the yellow arepa. The price was decent for the empanadas, but the arepas are confusing regarding price.  You buy the arepa and the meat is an additional price on top of the base price.  The main dishes looked overpriced, but I'd have to try them to see if maybe they're better or larger portions.  The service was good, but nothing special.  My water glass was never empty though, which is always a plus.  Also, they really need more sauces."
1,"=( I seriously expected far more. The appetizers were REALLY good The entrees were as small or EVEN SMALLER than the appetizers Furthermore, the entrees weren't as exciting, delicious or as imaginative as the appetizers were. We had the cuttlefish risotto-- very very good. the fry on the cuttlefish was great to balance the subtle flavor of the cuttlefish. the ink risotto was fantastic too we also ordered the chilled almond soup. delicious. the entrees weren't as amazing. I really expected more out of the sweetbread. sweetbread is on its own so flavorful! why the super fried crunch breading?? let me enjoy the sweetbread for what it has to offer on its own! we also had some other dish that i just cannot remember at all-- not good enough for me to even remember it! i will not come back. the entrees were SO FREAKIN SMALL!!! NOT a 'bang for your buck'. to be honest... i was so hungry after my meal... we went around the corner to Pomme Frites and i ordered myself up a wasabi frenchfries..... service at Degustation is great. area too small small small! NOT wheelchair friendly! You'll never wheel by anywhere! also not large gut friendly(you'll have to suck it in whenever someone needs to pass behind you to get by)"
1,"Order at register, get a buzzer and wait time depends on what you're getting. Overall, quick and convenient with plenty of seatings! I went with my friends here two weeks ago for the first time. I got there edamane salad with ginger dressing. It was good but nothing special. Last week I went alone to get lunch as well. I ordered two rolls of there sushi and it was delicious. There spicy tuna roll has yet to be my favorite on the menu now :D"
1,"We waited for almost an hour and a half and I do not regret it. I absolutely love the decor and atmosphere at ABC Kitchen. The entire staff was very polite and knowledgeable, which I really appreciate. The chef sent over Kabochi toast which was INCREDIBLE. For dinner I had the Snapper with chilies and herbs, and baby market potatoes and spinach. It is possibly the best dish I have ever tasted. I have heard wonderful things about their brunch and can't wait to go back."
0,"Getting right to the point..GO...get straight to the east coast over west coast. I am pretty sure my friend and I had 50 each, great drafts that pair well, and a super cool downtown vibe. The owner is great, get to know him. This is the way an oyster bar should be run. Limited menu thus all totally fresh and served with a smile....."
1,"Oh man! the last time I went to this place it was late at night, and I thought all of it was a dream! So the other day I met up with an old college friend (who is a pizza connoisseur) and took her here, even though I knew she would be a little hesitant about artichoke & pizza mixing together as one. But once we were served and took our first bites it was HEAVEN! The flavor of the pizza was so rich you might have thought for a nano second that you were Eve in the Garden of Eden taking a bite of that forbidden fruit. It wasn't until I was done with my pizza I realized that I forgot to take a picture of the slice to show and share with the world of Yelp. -[EPIC FAIL]-   Since there will be a next time and a time after that I will make sure to post a picture eventually!"
1,"The ambiance is pretty nice. My boyfriend and I went in around 7pm, the lights were dim, and there were many tables open. The waitress was kind and sweet. She did mention beforehand that all the dishes were appetizer sizes so that was a nice heads-up. We ordered a total of four dishes. All of them were tiny yet, oddly enough, when we completed our dinner and went back in the car, we were both very satisfied. I thought it was a nice experience to try four different and yummy dishes. It is a bit pricey but I'm not complaining because it's probably not somewhere I would choose as an annual spot. It was a pleasant overall experience."
0,"This place has the top burger in midtown. Dine in or delivery, their burger is always great. We typically get the sweet potato fries which are crazy fresh. Finally, a vanilla and raspberry shake is un-matched. For the quality you get, the price is worth it."
0,"I went to Cubana Social a few weeks ago and have been thinking about it ever since.  The atmosphere is great and I was seated right away.  I got an amazing cocktail that my server helped me pick out and it was EXACTLY what I wanted.  The food was fantastic.  To be honest, I don't know why I had never been before or heard how good this place is.  I shared some appetizers and small plates with my friend.  Everything we ate tasted really fresh and had so many flavors.  I went on a Friday night and they had a live band playing.  The music was great and everyone in the restaurant was clapping to the music.  It was just a great overall experience.  It's my new spot!"
0,"It looks much nicer from the outside! Service was poor and food was average, or worse..."
0,"One of my favorite neighborhood places to eat.  The staff is great, the chef terrific!  It is a little pricey for the neighborhood but well worth it.   I would recommend the mussels, the mac and cheese and if they every bring back the arugula salad with goat cheese it is a must have!"
1,"There was only one reason I was eating at Balthazar this morning -- brioche French toast. I had never had it before but Sooj's raving about it during our regular IM sessions about eating got me fixated on trying it. I mean, does brioche really make the difference between good French toast and OMFG French toast? The answer is ""yes."" Why Balthazar? Well, during my online research preceding our trip, it was one of the only places that served it as part of their regular breakfast menu and not just during Sunday brunch. I had no idea that it was one of those places where you might see a celebrity or two, or that it's actually pretty famous on its own. All I knew was that they had what I was looking for and it was walking distance from my friend's place, so I made a reservation. We were seated promptly on arrival at 10am and the restaurant was already bustling. It's very loud and busy, even at breakfast, and it was everything I ever imagined a New York restaurant would be. I wonder what this place is like at dinner. We started our breakfast with an apple galette and a homemade doughnut. The galette wasn't very big, but was the perfect breakfast ""appetizer."" The apples were tart and the pastry was buttery and flaky. It would also make a perfect dessert. The doughnut was a light, cake donut with a bit of sugar sprinkled on top. This was also good, and I'm not normally a fan of cake doughnuts. My wife ordered scrambled eggs with asparagus and wild mushrooms in a puff pastry. The scrambled eggs were perfect and you could tell that the eggs were very fluffy, a sign of fresh eggs. You could taste every buttery layer of eggs but it wasn't heavy at all. The puff pastry was perfect, and my wife was happy because we had been having bad luck with puff pastry at restaurants in the last few months. My brioche French toast was great. The thick slices of light, eggy bread were topped only with powdered sugar and two slices of applewood smoked bacon and served with a side of syrup. One bite and I was hooked. the crust was super crispy but not burnt, and I proceeded to cut the corners off the French toast to maximize the amount of crust in each bite. The bread was soft and pillowy and soaked up the syrup nicely. I normally like my bacon crispy, which wasn't the case with Balthazar's bacon, but I didn't care because the smokey flavor that permeated the meat more than made up for it. This New York trip, coupled with my addiction to Yelping and eating out, has helped me understand why people pay a little bit more money for good food. The simplicity of Balthazar's French toast paired with only a side of bacon may seem sparse and cost twice as much when compared to your typical American restaurant breakfast. I mean, I could have easily gone to IHOP or Denny's for French toast with eggs and bacon/sausage and hash browns, etc. and that would have filled me up, but was it really satisfying? Even when combined with the galette and the donut, our breakfast at Balthazar was both excellent and extremely satisfying without putting us into a food coma for the rest of the day."

1,"When I first tried out GO!GO!CURRY! (back in its early years), I didn't believe it was curry over rice, let alone be Japanese food. However, GO!GO!CURRY! changed my thoughts on Japanese cuisine overall. The Katsu Pork & Katsu Chicken in its breaded goodness was like the ticket to taste bud heaven upon first bite! This over a Katsu sauce and Japanese curry makes the taste unique. Also, some lettuce were thrown in to get the spicy side of things cooled down. Now, over the past half year, I've been back to try out their larger portions: The Grand Slam Curry ($12.50). To my amazement, it was the portion of two meals in one. Everything, including the fried shrimp, sausage, egg, pork & chicken katsu, and (of course) the Japanese curry was flawless in taste! Alright, for those who are daring (like I was) and are REALLY hungry, the WORLD CHAMPION CURRY will blow you away! Words can't describe the awesomeness of this dish... you have to see it to believe it! The people who work at GO!GO!CURRY! are very pleasant to be with. They serve your order as fast as possible and are very cheery, which proves that they seem to like what they do! Overall, if you're in the mood for something other than Sushi, burgers, fries, or other typical cuisines, give GO!GO!CURRY! a try and you'll want to go back again for more!"
1,"The Odeon......we never had a bad meal there. great juicy burger, and they always always have the best soup. whenever you want a casual dinning, go to Odeon, they won't let you down. my husband's grandma has her birthday party there, we had our wedding party there......and we still going back."
0,What recession?  Lines 10 deep for an $8 small sandwich and NO SUBSTITUTIONS!  You vill have mayonnaise and you vill like it!
1,10/10 Tapas muy delicioso. Jaw dropping amazingness at holy shit low prices. Wine/sangria a must. EXCELLENT service too
0,These burgers are top notch plus AMAZING turkey and veggie burgers to boot! Great beers on tap and extra bonus is the outdoor seating now that the weather is warming up! I went back for a second time this week! Make sure you ask for the tasty special sauce. The special sauce is SPECIAL. I can't wait till they start serving brunch!
1,"For what it is, you really can't do any better than this cart. The amount of food is plentiful, the price is more than reasonable, and it is an experience in and of itself. Since most of the other stuff has been hit to death, I'll make a few recommendations: -The lamb is excellent, and the chicken is very good too. -Getting either meat over rice is a bigger meal (and more bang for your buck). That said, the flavor of the sandwich is very good too. What I would do is team up with a friend and split both a sandwich and a meat over rice. Works nicely. -For the love of all that is holy, ask for the red sauce on the side and put it in small amounts at a time. I like spicy more than almost anyone, and putting it in by anything more than a dab from a fork at a time will cause major problems, especially the first time. -Get the white sauce on it there. Damn good. -Be ready for a line. We got relatively lucky both times I went, but be prepared to wait for a while and be ready to want to eat it immediately. All in all, it is some good eats at a great price. If you can live with yourself long enough to wait, taking it into Central Park (just a few blocks north) can work very well too, as long as you bring napkins and drinks to absorb the heat."
1,"Many traditional Roman dishes!! Fantastic cacio e pepe -- that's a hard one to get right -- and have professional, helpful staff. An excellent stuffed rabbit and outstanding braised oxtails.  A bottle of Ruché di Castagnole was perfect - light and fruity. Will head back there soon."
0,"Comparable to any of the best steak places - at an amazing price.  Beautiful meat, perfectly cooked.  Great sides.  And an awesome little bar tacked on the side for a pre dinner drink.  Get there early - lines around the block"
0,"Great place for the neighborhood, whether dinner or brunch. Really enjoyed the atmosphere there and definitely the food. BYOB!"
0,"Declining food quality and rude to my grandparents, who helped this place take off when it first opened."
0,"Went once, not so good- attributed it to being newly opened. Went again almost 2 years later. Not so good.  Service is poor, well let me rephrase. Service is insolent, condescending and quite honestly, the best person on the floor (management included) was the runner/bus boy.  Sorry I wasn't wearing my highwaisted camel toe jeans and my date wasn't sporing a beard- perhaps if we looked like tourist hipsters instead of people who lived in the neighborhood for 10+ years the service would have been better.... as far as the food, it was fair- nothing special- problem is, even if it was stellar, the shitty service kind of put the kibosh on the whole meal. will never be back- nor will recommend."
0,"No frills burger and beer joint that does the job but could do with a touch more innovation and the dingy digs make this more of a swing by, quick fix joint then a savory experience. A little variety to the fries is always a sure fire way to accent the basic burger- steak, curly, sweet potato, etc. -but you'll get none of that here. It's just the basics- burger, fries, cheese if ya want and some surly service. There are better choices- Five Guys is not far away and they offer a superior albeit florescent lit experience."
0,"Can't beat the desserts.  However, the food was pretty good too.  The only negative was the long wait for a table.  We had to catch a show so we ordered take-out and ate it outside (in 20 degree weather).  Would definitely return."
0,"Breeders Club of America-Middleton NJ (Buyers Beware)   Specifics Date of Purchase-09/12/13   Names of employees we spoke to-Jennifer & Veronica Price of purchase-$2901.19 (Dog, Vet Warranty, Cage, Freight and handling charge, tax, food & vitamins) payment via AMEX Breed-French Bulldog   Phone Number-732-706-3444 to give you an overview of the situation- My wife called Breeders Club of America in Middletown, NJ on Thurs at 4 pm ,She asked specifically for a Boston Terrier Dog, Jennifer replied ""We have 4""  Our family drove 2 hours in traffic to the store and asked to see the Boston Terrier's we just called about- Jennifer said ""You won't believe it but we sold em in the last 2 hours"" So now I have my 2 & 7 year old sons going gaga over all the dogs, Jennifer explains, how about a French Bulldog, very similar to the BT.. we explained we just drove 2 hours and our price range was $800 to $1200..She comes back with a price of $4000.00- we then pull her aside and say our 2 kids have been looking at video's of BT dogs and we are now in a bad position as they have their heart set on leaving with the BT dog- I also explain my 7 year old son Marco is autistic and is now crying and anxious that we are leaving without the puppy. As we're about to leave with 2 crying kids she says ""How about $2200 all in"" Being a parent I felt cornered and agreed to the purchase as Marco was hyperventilating and my 2 year old Dominick was crying as he noticed how upset Marco was.. So now the fun begins.. I explain that we drove all this way and I would agree to the purchase for my kids-so they quickly rambled through a 5 page contract and had me quickly initial & sign all pages, they next ask for my Amex and SWIPE it and the total comes to $2951.19- I ask ""what are the add'l charges""- They Say, ""6 month initial mandatory VET fee-$99.00 and $60.00 handling fee""- I asked why didn't they explain that and they answered ""it's standard in all our contracts""- At this point with 2 crying kids, thunder & lightening, I sign the AMEX receipt and leave.. This morning (09/13/13)10 hours after purchase my 7 year old wakes up at 6 am with swollen eyes and coughing. I pack up everything and drive back to the store that opens at 11 am-I explain my story in detail and show her pictures of my son and also offer to help promote the sale of the dog/ The manager or owner of the store who was so nice the day before says ""We can't do nothing- it's in the contract, store credit only"" I said, I can't use a store credit as my son is obviously allergic and I don't want to take another chance, I also said ""Why wouldn't you tell the clients you can't return the dog?""  She persists and says ""either it's store credit or take the dog, if you leave the dog I'll call the police, you can't by law leave the dog here"" She then takes my contract and brings in the back office and locks the door.. Rather than make a scene or call the cops I took the store credit which clearly says ""Not Transferable"" We called for a copy of our contract and they will not give it to us. We did some further research and found out the puppy had 2 surgeries at birth and has an under bite which they never spoke about but I'm sure buried it in the 5 page contract. I now have my attorney involved which found NUMEROUS complaints about this company's scams & complaints. Rest assured I'll make sure no future honest people will be taken advantage of.   I feel deceived, and after now reading all the consumer complaints I feel even worse.  (Links Below) Links to complaints below (American Puppy Club) ripoffreport.com/r/Ameri… consumeraffairs.com/pets… meetup.com/FAUNNJ/events… complaintsboard.com/comp…"
0,"I haven't actually eaten at any of the restaurants within eataly, but the foccacia pizza is ridiculously good.  Only $2.80 and it still feels like you're eating something fancy.  gooooooooooooooooood comfort food!  The place itself is uncomfortably crowded at all times which is the only thing that sometimes keeps me from going there."
0,"Oh Traif, a restaurant that serves all of my favourite things was always going to be a winner. The food was great, quite a varied menu that is made up of smaller sharing dishes. A nice spread of options that were well done. The food wasn't 'gastronomy' but it was very flavourful and non-pretentious which I prefer. I would say as a warning - the dishes are billed as 'small plates' but they aren't all that small! We ordered 5 at the recommendation of our waiter but we were stuffed at four (might have been what we ordered though as we went for quite heavy rich food). It's not cheap but neither eyewateringly expensive our meal plus quite a few drinks came to $120 (not inc tip). If you like pork and seafood I would definitely recommend Traif."
0,"Loved the huge pepperoni pizza my family and I ordered to share! I must admit, I have had better pizza in the Little Italy area of Manhattan, but nonetheless, this place is an experience of its own!"
0,"Cute place, food is good and authentic. I love the atmosphere and the staff is friendly.  The duck with mole sauce was really good and my husband got the grilled porgy with plantain. Definitely recommend."
0,"Feeling really ripped off going to this place. I was really excited to try this place after getting a recommendation from a friend an artist that lives in Brooklyn. Sounded amazing, an off the grid(bushwick)sushi joint which fantastic reviews on yelp. Unfortunately, its simply not worth it. The positives, the space is really cool. Kinda like someone's garage that got pimped out. And the owner is a very friendly guy. The bad - the quality of the sushi is just not good. We got the 70 dollar per person pre-fix so i tried a little bit of everything. They have the sushi bombs, which is really just a piece of fish sushi over a bigger ""bomb"" sized piece of rice and a dab of Mayonnaise. The rice cold and the fish chewy. I really don't get it, I could have to gotten similar quality fish from Duane Reade. We also got this special steak that is supposed to be even better then Kobe. I forgot what the name was, and it might ahve been but it was so overcooked that it tasted no better then the steak you get on manager's special. I guess that what I get for ordering steak at a sushi joint. Skip this place if you live in Manhattan. Any mid-tier sushi joint would be better then this."
1,Cafe Habana is a drunken-late-night-munchie kinda place. Two sides that I love to get here? The grilled corn (duh) and the TOSTONES. I'm a huge fan of tostones and I get super excited when I find a place that makes a good batch. It's hard to find tostones that are satisfying and NOT swimming in a bath of oil and grease. Green plantains deep fried to a crispy golden brown finish = heaven. Pair that with Cafe Habana's yummy garlic dipping sauce and voila!
0,love it...met the owners..great peeps..love the cheese...
0,This is a little gem. Best spot in the west village!
1,My fiancé and I frequently visit on Sunday afternoons and we're always bringing out of town friends to this local spot. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff members are pretty cool. Great beer selection and nice cocktails. If ya need something to fill you up and taste good the food is simple and delicious.
1,"First saw it on No Reservations, absolutely lives up to Bourdain's stellar review.  The brunch menu is incredible and they've got specials that will make your mouth spin.  In a good way."
0,Cheap. Fast. Yummy
0,"Great New American food! I went here with a friend for her birthday, and we had an awesome time. The server was enthusiastic and helpful, and the food came out very fast!"
1,"Not only was the wait staff rude (guy in a jean jacket vest repeatedly pushed past me and only uttered ""excuse you"") but after a long wait we never got the apple pies we paid $4 each for! Will not come back."
1,"been here twice--and never been disapointed. attentive and outstanding waitstaff, nice decor with kpop playing in the background. here goes the food: seafood pancake: MUST get this. it was cooked perfectly, not too greasy, not too skimpy with the seafood. kimchi fried rice: dont bother, it even had carrots *cringes* and it was mediocre at best. seafood bowl with noodles: this is the dish where they bring out a huge pot of seafood (clams, mussels, conch, crab) and you eat the seafood then they boil the noodles for you in the broth. STUNNING. i could eat this every meal every day. the broth is not too fishy or seafood tasting, it tastes perfect. the noodles that come out in the end are juicy and soak up all that goodness from the broth. the clams are gargantous and arent overcooked at all. cucumber juice: BLOWS MY MIND how they can make this taste like heaven. its crisp, not too cucumber-tasting, and not too sweet either. WIN WIN WIN. if i lived next door to this restaurant, trust that i would be there every day."
0,I've given a two star rating because of my last visit to AR. It seemed like they were purposely sending out the most horrible and cold food they possibly could. Sad part is that I have had a delivery from this place and it was pretty good. I took 3 friends to eat here and I looked like a moron for picking this place. Even the tater tots and soup was cold. How is that possible?
1,so good lovit!
1,"Wow! Yum! For a place we ended up at purely because they would take a reservation for our large party, I was pleasantly surprised. You can be pretty healthy with some brunch options, and the portions are very reasonable. I had the Mediterranean breakfast with two eggs, labneh, chopped salad, and avocado. Others got the green shakshuka, and the croque Madame special. They looked really good too. I would probably try the grapefruit with granola and yogurt next time. Don't come here before noon Sunday because they won't serve cocktails, and don't come if you're really hungover because it's pretty loud and cramped. Like I had to sit up straight because people kept bumping into my slouch at the communal bench."
0,"A very good place to eat Italian. They are fast, nice and funny. My order was thier pasta special, ""Sinfonia de Paste"" I have never had that good bolognese or linocchi. The noice is high but it gives the place a great feeling. Don Not go here with kids if your are not conforable in noisy crowded places."
0,This may be the greatest spot in all of NYC.  My office is right around the block.  I have been going for a few years now and visit a couple of times a week.  At first I thought about keeping it a secret so as not to ruin it.  Soon enough word got out to my friends and co-workers and they are all regulars.  This however has not ruined the quality or atmosphere at all.  They even started a weekend Brunch menus which is amazing in itself.  Darren the owner and chef has some amazing food concoctions that amount to a food chemistry experiment!
1,"I don't really know what the big hype about this place is.  I ate there tonight expecting the best meal ever from what I gathered from all these reviews.  It ended up being mediocre.  I had the polish platter as most people recommended it, yet the only thing that I thought was amazing out of the entire dish was the kielbasa.  The stuffed cabbage seemed like it had been sitting there all day; not fresh by any means.  The potatoes were stiff and not fluffy.  Maybe I went in expecting too much."
0,"I love the feel of this cozy corner culinary compound of cubano and corn (like that alliteration? haha). Steel fans blowing overhead. Cramped, cushioned booths in loud blue vinyl.   I typically despise waiting long for a simple meal, but for Cafe Habana I would wait... and wait..."
0,"Went for Friday lunch with a friend, so it was nice and quiet.  Service 8 out of 10, only because 1 person working the entire place so chef was coming out serving food too.  Food came out slow and not in order.  Not a big deal, but my pet peeve is filling the water glasses without having to ask.   That said, Food: CRAZY Excellent!!!  Escargot was probably the best I have every had.  I have had escargot at 5 star restaurants in CT where many elite dine and these topped them all.  We also shared the muscles in white wine sauce and they were perfect. Moist and clean.  Then lobster ravioli for me which was totally fab as well.  Linguini a la scampi for my friend was awesome too. If you are looking for a little taste of everything good, I suggest ordering and sharing.  Its that good! D."
1,My friend introduced me to this place and I have to say it's pretty high ranked in my top meals I've eaten in New York.  It feels authentic French cuisine even if their menu is predominantly crepes.  The owners are very sweet and gave us great service.  Highly highly recommend it.
1,"Wow, just wow. The sushi here is the best I've had anywhere (note: never been to Japan). It's fun sitting at the bar and having the sushi chef make each individual sushi for us. I want to take my mom here!"
0,"The food was awesome and the drinks was amazing, I definitely will come back again. The salmon is amazing if your looking for seafood. I tried the mac & cheese which is also good as a appetizer. I came from happy hour and the drinks weren't bad. The view by the water was spectacular. The service was great & music was very good"
0,"I like a good balance of chick pea to tahini, balanced with some lemon juice and a touch of oil.  Since i have such stringent criteria for hummus it is hard to be satisfied! What WAS excellent was the cucumber yogurt sauce and beyoglu salad.  They have a great outdoor patio area and even if you have to eat inside the decor is bright and fun.  The service could have been better. Overall we were pleased with our time at Beyoglu, but not so much that I think I'll add it to our regular list of restaurants."
0,Lively atmosphere great to go with a group of friends. The burgers are delicious !
0,Stopped in for dinner Monday night and had a damn good roasted chicken breast with some fine hand made pasta. I can't remember the name of the fish my lady had but it was also very tasty. Corn Chowder also gets a thumbs up.
1,"The flourless chocolate cake is so amazing here! As is the diner burger, which is served most days. The menu changes often and the waiters write the menu on you table. The interior is really cool and the food is always fresh."
0,very cute little italian restaurant - love it!
1,"I'm sad to say that I am disappointed by this place. They do not take reservations and I was here for dinner on a weekend. Not only did my party and I wait 2-3 hours nearby just for a meal here, I wasn't impressive by my food. I've had better ramen so this was not mind blowing awesome. Also, for the price and food, this place is definitely too hyped up and overrated."
0,"One of the best pizza's I've had in New York City When we got there the guy at the front was pleasant but told us the wait was like 2 hours. We asked for take out instead and he said no can do. After awhile, and a bit of pressure and persistence we allowed us to put in our order. I came all the way from Manhattan for this pizza so I wasn't leaving without it. Glad he lightened up and took our order. Cool atmosphere and good people watching"
0,"I was in New York for a week on work and I managed to eat here twice. You might say that is a foolish choice in a city with a million unbelievable restaurants, but it was worth it. The ambiance is everything that I would ask for in a restaurant. Cozy, romantic, dreamy.  The food sealed the deal. It was delicious! My friend and I ordered everything to split so we could sample as many of the amazing sounding items as we could manage. All good! It was possibly my most happy dining experience. Plus I saw Josh Hartnett dining there with his oh so cool dude friends and oh so annoying girl friends and I realized ""Hey, he kinda is a heart throb..."""
0,"overpriced, not that great"
1,"Delicious food albeit small portions. My group of 5 and I made reservations about 2 weeks in advance for the small little Japanese treasure. We were sooo pumped to try the famed hot pot and tonsoku (pig's feet!). We sat and quickly ordered, waiting patiently for our food. They start off giving you warm towels to wash off with, which was a nice touch! Their bathroom is also fully stocked I might add - free tampons and q tips! haha. When the hot pot arrived, it looked glorious - heaps of veggies piled on this simmering pork broth. We were instructed to wait 20 mins for it to cook before eating. Once it's all cooked though, it was barely enough food for us. We quickly ordered another order of ramen noodles and a second portion of the tonsoku - which was superb. All in all, a cute experience in a quintessential Japanese restaurant tucked away in the West Village. Great waitstaff and delicious food - just as long as you are aware you won't be stuffed afterwards!"
0,racist.
0,"Best Indian food in NY hands down! The chicken and lamb dishes are absolutely superb! Great atmosphere, music, food and drinks you just can't wrong. UES has been craving for a restaurant/bar like this for years! It is now my regular."
1,"Great dinner with my fraternal little bro. Special props to our server Alexis, she's terrific."
1,"Oh Ladurée you never fail me.. A lil pricey for macaron but you get what you get! And I'm so excited you got one down here in miami! Plus plus plus another star! I try everything from the normal chocolate, pistachio to the extreme like rose petal and black currant! Love it! Be back soon!"
0,"Simply amazing. Was lucky enough to have a private cocktail party before hand. The wine was great, but I felt they had too many non-vegetarians dishes while they were serving before our meal. First course: insalata, which had tasty greens, a delicious manchego cheese, with radish and sherry. For the main meal I had the Tortelli which was an amazing ricotta & mascarpone ravioli with a red wine glaze. To top off the meal I had an irresistible raspberry ice cream. Hmmm I want more! The three courses were terrific. Wish there were more vegetarian options but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal."
1,"Bloody Marys are back on track and tasty again! They're still not quite as banging as they were before, but still some of the better ones in the city that I've tried. This place redeemed itself. :)"
0,"I don't think the staff here really understands how restaurant seating works. I guess these are franchises, but I think Bareburger should have some universal policies on this stuff- when one place doesn't really know what they're doing, it doesn't look good for the brand. I went to this Bareburger last week solo, and all ten high top seats were free (all other tables were occupied). I asked if I could sit there, and they said they were reserved for large parties. I also could not eat at the area where the tables are built into the wall, as those were reserved for people waiting for takeout. I'll add that 1) neither of these sections are popular, people would much rather wait for the regular tables or booths 2) the hi-top section can seat multiple parties of one, two or three- it's not an issue to do this  3) this isn't a ""linger"" type of dining experience- especially if you're solo- it's an in-and-out kind of place and I would have been out in less than half an hour and 4) you can always seat someone and just say that if a large party does come in, they'll have to move you. I ended up sitting at the ""waiting area"", as I had opted for takeout (they told me there would be a ten minute wait and I figured I could order and be out of there with food by then), and no one, not one person sat in those empty 10 hi-tops. In the ""waiting area"", two parties of two sat for two minutes each, waiting for tables. This was an inane policy, and I'll note that I've visited the Park Slope location of Bareburger several times and if there's an empty seat, well, they'll seat you, they'll figure it out. Because they understand that while someone might be alone THIS time and not the bigger money, if their experience is good, they just might come back with five friends next time and fill up a hi-top. But I won't be going back to this location, alone or with a group. Ever. Only gets two stars because the takeout guy was incredibly nice, helpful and accommodating. The rest of the staff? Made me feel pretty unwelcome. Management needs to figure it out."
0,"I finally made to this place after million years.. For some reason I always thought this is an underground teahouse. My first impression of this place was alright. perhaps I excepted something greater. Anyhow, I order Hibisceus ice-tea. something they showed a picture in the menu ( i always go for the pictures) it turned out very good. I'm not a tea expert. I don't know if it's up to the tea standards. All I can say is it tasted good to me.. very fruity. Good place for date!!"
0,"I compare all other Italian restaurants in NYC to Lupa.  And I always go back to Lupa as my absolute favorite.  The Bucatini all'Amatriciana is the best outside of Rome.  Rezzies are hard to come by, so call two weeks in advance or go last minute  & have a glass or two of wine at the bar while you wait.  It's worth the wait!!   And if they have Osso Bucco or brussel sprouts sprouts on the menu that day, order them!"
0,"I ordered from them on seamlessweb.com, the estimated delivery was 30-45 minutes, after an hour I called to ask when I would be receiving my food and they said it was on its way.  10 minutes later I called again and then they told me that they were still cooking the food, that they would then have to wait for the delivery guy to return and estimated another half an hour.  I could forgive that if it wasn't for the fact that the woman on the phone was not at all, as one would expect, apologetic but rather very annoyed that I wanted to know when I could expect my food to arrive.  I told her that I didn't want it any more and she slammed down the phone at me."
1,love it!
0,"This is delicious. I order at least once a week and my two favorite dishes are Chicken Pad Thai and Beef Pad See Ew. I could eat this every night, but would end up the size of a house, so just restrict it to once a week. You wouldnt believe the will power this involves ;)"
0,I eat pizza about once a week and this is the best one I've ever had. Thank God I don't live in NYC because I would be fat as a cow and broke in a couple of months.
1,Great service and second time was as good as the first.  I love the prix fixe menu with the cheese and bread options.  They had just started the 3 course dessert tasting at the bar.  I asked the waiter if we could have the just 1 of the 3rd dessert.  The chef was more than willing to accommodate.   Both times the desserts were amazing and the other courses were perfect.  I would recommend anyone looking for great food and is adventuresome.
1,"It's sad. I really have a tough time giving an establishment a one star. But it really was 1 star. Maybe no stars. Overpriced, most definitely. You need to work on offering more quality for the prices your charging. It's just not appropriate. The taste of the dishes also need work. Consider hiring a new chef. It just fell short."
1,"Cha An is a small little second floor walk up with friendly service that comes with a smile. It's great for a romantic date or meeting up with a small group of friends to sample some Japanese desserts and a variety of tea. I had the matcha macaroons which were easily one of my favorite little snacks. The other stuff was just okay, and that's including the ever popular black sesame creme brulee. Not very impressed with it."
1,I've biked and walked past this place a million times but never went in until a few days ago. Ended up being a lot larger than I had expected and wasn't too crowded (it was a weeknight though). They have a couple of arcade games and a pool table and a few nice booths. Hopefully this place isn't as packed as I'd guess it might get on the weekends!
1,"I am always a bit reticent to try ""fancier"" pizza places.  But no one should fear trying the pizza at Rubirosa.  Outstanding!  They are very accommodating - you can get half of one pie, half of another, on the same pie.  I think at no additional cost.  The sauce tasted like it was made that morning with tomatoes fresh off the vine.  The toppings were also fresh from the garden. But also truly outstanding here is the pasta.  I rarely order pasta at restaurants because it seems so easy, so unremarkable.  I have been mistaken in this belief for some time, I believe.  If a place makes their own pasta, I think I need to be more openminded. If you can scope whether their pasta is excellent in advance, all the better. Here, the pasta is outstanding!  The flavor is really different from the ordinary pasta you are likely used to.  Fresher.  And the ingredients in it, like the pizza, are really fresh. Only thing I ordered and could care less for - the duck bruschetta.  I just was not into the duck at all.  However, the shrimp bruschetta was really tasty.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  Kind of hard to eat though. Service was nice.  Our server was laidback, accommodating, chill.  I felt like I'd want to be friends with her. As one from DC where prices are a bit lower than NY, generally, I was really pleased with how affordable Rubirosa was, too."
0,dont eat here there open 24hours so when do they claen there gill....it sucks sorry
1,"Watching that new food truck show on The Food Network got me wondering why the Vietnamese truck seemed to be doing the less work but making the most money. Don't get me wrong, the food looks good and I bet smell good but still. Whats the hype about. This is where Yelp* comes in. Bored at work I started searching for Vietnamese sandwiches. Num Num (the trucks name on the show) speacialize in Vietnamese sandwiches. They look so good that I had to try out. So last night after work mt gf and I made our why downtown to Grand st to Banh Mi Saigon for some sandwiches. New location with a modern decor makes this place different from it's last location. The pplace is pretty big with only a couple seats. they are actually stools with table space to eat your sandwich. Before you reach the order counter there is also a lady selling jewelery. Finally the food. You can order a pork, chicken, sardine, meatball or beef Banh mi. We had two pork. One of them being spicy. First bite was great. All the flavors made this one good sandwich. Someone on Yelp* described it as sweet and salty and that exactly what it is. Good portion of pork, carrots, cilantro and other stuff. I was full with just one half of the sandwich aswell as my gf. The only reason I gace Banh Mi Saigon 4 stars and not 5 is because the sandwiches were not fresh. I guess because they are so cheap the place may fill up at times so they want to be ready. The sandwihes are sitting under a heat lamp to keep them hot. Heat lamps usually dont work. They make the bread hard and turn the mayo in oil. The sadnwich was still really good but I like my food freshly made. But really, what can you expect from a really big sandwich that cost $3.75? I will definetly begoing back for more and I will also ask for a fresh one."
1,"I have not been compelled to review a restaurant for a little while. The Gramercy Tavern compelled me to, with their excellent service and food. Out of all the plates that we had, I have to comment on their Mushroom Lagsane. Full of woody mushroom flavor, topped with a demi-glace and slivers of crisped garlic. I am salivating as I am writing about this. The sea bass was fresh, cooked well, with grilled asparagus that was cooked but crunchy, with mushrooms and an amazing mushroom puree. I think the chef may have forgotten to salt the seafood broth. But the moment we seasoned, the flavors popped. Unfortunately, it may have been half a bowl of broth too late. The duck salad is delicious. The fried oysters were wonderful. The pistachio brown sugar cake was ordinary after a wonderful chocolate cake with sour cream ice cream and hazelnut crumble. I am a fan."
0,"I love this place: good food and drinks, young and multicultural ambiance."
0,"Mmmmm Gitane!  I can't believe they prep all of the delicious food in that tiny open kitchen space!  Best time to go is winter, when you can get the lentil soup and gut-warming mulled wine."
0,"This was actually my first time to try a banh mi sandwich.  I have no words for how delicious it was.  I had several friends say this place serves the best banh mi in New York.  I highly recommend you try it.  There is seating, or you can take your food to go.  The portions are huge and the prices are very low.  I loved it and will definitely be going back."
1,"too oily, too thick crusted. like eating an oily bread. i guess it's ok for the price....and if you're a college kid hanging out late in the village...already drunk."
0,"Me and my friend had dinner at Ssam bar. All of food we had was so satisfying. Usually I prefer entire traditional food to fusion which is like combining little bit of Korean and little bit of something else, But this place is exceptional. Food at Saam bar is very tasty well made fusion rather than experimental random taste of fusion. We had santa barbara uni, pork belly steamed buns, roasted duck. and market greens with ox sauce. Pork belly was very yummy. The best of the best was ""Santa Barbara Uni"" though. The fresh Uni with seaweed, piece of pear, and tofu whipping cream was just fabulous combination of flavor. On the day I saw lots of people had spicy pork sausage & rice cakes. Assume that it's popular menu there. This place is stunning. - I would recommend anyone who haven't been to this place yet."
0,"I don't know what all the hype is about. After waiting about 25 minutes in line outside, we were seated and placed our order for a small onion pizza. Then the wait began, a 45 minute wait.... for a small pizza. We were told numerous times that it would just a another minute. The service was meh... the pizza was meh... This is an hour and a half of my life wasted!!!"
0,"Great tapas, great wine, and great service. Definitely a place that I recommend. I've been back a number of times and love this place."
0,"Many people, including myself, have allergies or intolerances to different foods. I have an intolerance to gluten (the protein found in wheat, rye, barley and some oats). So this restaurant is so awesome to me because I can go there and find gluten-free breadsticks, pizza, beer, paninis and baked goods including their delicious tiramisu! I can't eat any regular bread or pizza or pasta so every time I visit New York City, this place is a special treat for me to visit. They also have a lot of vegan items as well. I wish they'd open one in Orlando... :)"
1,"It was just normal pizza. I honestly didn't get what the hype was all about. It's definitely better than that PizzaHut/Dominos crud but....in the end it didn't impress me. We went in the evening and the wait was a good hour, and place was extremely crowded; there was no room to wait inside so we were stuck outside in below freezing weather :(. Lucky for us, the area had lots of cool boutiques to shop around at and we were able to do that and come back to wait for our name to be called. Rice to Riches is across the street! Go look at the cute signs :). It was yummy, and I feel bad to give it the rating that I do but our pizza was just pizza. Nothing spectacular about it and nothing to die for. It's nice to come here to look at all the amazing celebrities on the wall and there are lots of nice up-close pizza photos as well."
0,"Honestly, its a bit overrated. I mean the food is good, not going to lie. But the way everyone raves about the soup dumplings makes it seem as if its the greatest soup dumplings mankind has ever made. The soup dumplings are good, a bit small, but good. Nothing too fancy. The sauce that came with it was a little strong for me, but everyone has their own preferences. The restaurant was definitely cramped since its so popular. I was a bit disappointed that my friends and I had to situate ourselves in the same table as another couple. Kind of awkward and not too pleasant of an experience. Their food in general is pretty good if you're looking for a more authentic Chinese food tasting experience. But don't be hyped up coming in about the soup dumplings or you may be disappointed."
0,"My dinner at Vitae was nothing short of exquisite. My boyfriend and I were celebrating his graduation and decided to go all out and ordered the chef's tasting menu. We were not disappointed. Each dish was a celebration of the senses. We enjoyed ceviche, scallops, three different pasta dishes, lamb and sea bass. To top it all off, I had a chocolate soufflé, which was served with espresso and cream on the side. The chef suggested I break open the soufflé and pour the hot beverage into it, and so I did. This was, hands down, the best dessert I've ever had in my life. It actually made me want to cry! How often does food make you emotional?? The service was also excellent -- attentive, courteous but not overbearing. We were served dessert wine on the house, too! I cannot say enough about this wonderful new gem in Midtown. I plan to return regularly and am looking forward to sharing this find with friends and family. I wish the owner/chef all the best in this new endeavor. I expect it to be a huge success!"
1,"SoCo has been on my list of places to check out for a while; however, it had always been just a bit too far out of the way. I recently found myself in the neighborhood around dinner time and made a b-line for the restaurant. Upon getting there I was greeted by a bouncer (really?) who informed me that I would have to remove my hat if I wanted to go in. So much for casual attire. I cruise up to the host with some mean hat hair and, despite the place being packed, am able to get seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I ordered a cucumber something or other to drink as it sounded like a nice refreshing drink to have on an early summer evening. Despite the fact that it was supposed to be mixed with gin and a few other ingredients the only thing I could taste was cucumber. Drinking it through a straw was out if the question as it was constantly getting blocked up with cucumber guts. We ordered the mussels for our appetizer which quickly came out and were devoured even faster - good job there. Then we waited... And waited... And waited some more for our entrees. Finally they arrive. My plate looked like I ordered fries with a side of cheeseburger - there had to be enough to feed a family. But really, I'm a fatty at heart and love french fries, so I was celebrating on the inside. The fries had a great crispy texture; however, they tasted overcooked/burnt. My burger was just ok. My girlfriend had the lobster, shrimp and grits and said the lobster was a bit rubbery and had a bit of an off-putting flavor. Overall I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. The prices felt a bit high for the quality of the food and drinks. The atmosphere a bit too sleek and industrial for southern comfort food. This city has it's fair share of amazing southern spots and the next time I'm in the mood my hat and I will probably travel elsewhere."
1,"If you are even thinking of getting sushi in Northern Brooklyn, Momo Sushi Shack should be at the top of your list. Our food was amazing; the dishes were colorful, flavorful and prepared with care. Our tofu salad had locally grown tomatoes that the owner/chef explained to us had been soaking in soy sauce and basil for five weeks. The time and effort that goes into their food is worth it because the end result are carefully crafted bites of perfection. I like to nitpick my food but I left Momo with nothing to complain about: the rice was perfect, the vegetables were fresh and visually our plates were art. Usually as a vegetarian, I'm left looking for what I will/won't eat on a menu but the Sushi Shack has a huge vegetarian selection and these dishes are not afterthoughts! Highlights: the vegetarian Inari, Futomaki and the Vegan Eel Bomb. Fantastic stoner food! Our servers were friendly, attentive and interesting (our host was dancing, singing, cracking jokes as he made his way through the room). The atmosphere is cozy, with four or five long, family style tables. I will be back to Momo as soon as possible to sample the rest of their menu and seasonal specials. I've heard that this crew is opening a sandwich shop in my neighborhood (near the Jefferson L stop) and my mouth is already watering."
0,food is OK but soup..hot 'n' sour its horrible . its far from hot 'n' sour . sorry who ever the chef is got to re-do the recipe. its missing three biggest thing being that soup....1 texture 2 taste 3 colour but i Love to come back with my frds good luck
1,"Fantastic! The service was absolutely wonderful and so was the food. Highly recommend the mushroom crusted chicken, so delicious!"
1,"It's A-OK.  Ingredients taste extremely fresh, but there's nothing really REALLY special about their pizza."
1,"The Dark Horse knows how it do it right, especially if you're looking for a perfect place for your Fantasy Football draft. They provide free Wifi, and the many tables and open spaces promise to give your group plenty of space to spread out and get setup without worry of other patrons hitting your computer. You'll find the food here is solid, with a few items that are great, and a few lackluster. On the great side, the Dark Horse burger is a shining example of deliciousness. It's a monster, and contains everything from Bacon and fried egg to gravy sauce, all served with any toppings you could want. The only thing missing is the kitchen sink, and it's wonderful. On the not so great scale, the wings have an odd aftertaste and feel like they could be the type of frozen food wings you could find at the local grocery store and fry yourself. It could have just been our batch but I'd shy again from them as the rest of the menu holds up well. Beer specials are abundant, and the service is always quick and ready to provide a refill to keep you going as long as you want. Around happy hour time the crowd picks up, but never feels as crowded as so many other places in the area. If you want to mix it up a little, or watch a game and feel like you need a few more screens in your life, I recommend stopping by."
1,"The food is fine, the atmosphere is really nice and the servers are cordial but... This the food is not all that great and a bit inconsistent. We got two salads and my chicken was under seasoned and over cooked. The goat cheese tart was really fabulous and I would go back for that item alone. The coffee was just o.k. Overall, it is a nice brunch place but I get the feeling the reviews are higher for the location and place itself, not so much for the food. This happens to be a celeb spot as well, not sure if that is why this place is so popular. There are many other great lunch places around this area with better food."
1,"Maysville lies along the W 26th St. stretch that includes the BBQ-themed restaurant Hill Country and the more conventional Ainsworth Sports Bar. It caters to the suited crowd of West Flatiron while delivering a fresh take on the whiskey tavern and Kentucky cuisine. The front bar area is warmed by an amber wall of bourbon. Here I enjoyed a habanero-infused Manhattan and followed it up with the poached egg grits with duck confit. While the cocktail could have stood a bit more spice, the poached eggs were some of the best I have tasted. The service was attentive but not too clingy. Special kudos to the staff for providing complementary appetizer biscuits as well as tasty caramel chocolates with our dessert. And did I mention the bread pudding? Savory yet not overly rich, this dish is a reason in itself to return."
1,"I came to NYC from Boston for a long weekend this past winter, and Empanada Mama was the highlight of the trip. Seriously. This place is great because: * It's unexpected. At least it was for me. I was staying near Times Square, being grumpy about having to eat touristy food, when this turned up on trusty Yelp. * It's friendly. The atmosphere and the staff. * Great margs. Super delish and fresh tasting. And strong. *  Empanadas! So fun and tasty. Love that you can order these as your whole meal or as apps, which is what I did. Next time, I'd just have a pile of empanadas and be a happy camper. And the dessert empanadas: Yum. * It's not expensive, but the food is of good quality. Overall, I came away from this meal painfully full and in a very good mood. It'll be on the itinerary whenever I visit NY."
0,"I have been coming here with my girlfriend since they opened last year.  Phenomenal tacos, burritos, nachos.  Stand outs are the pollo and al pastor options.  Extra salsa bar is a perfect touch to make every experience special. The staff is friendly and attentive which is few and far between off St. Mark's.  I hope this place sticks around as it has gained a full time position in my EV food rotation. Thank you Diana"
1,"The cafe is one of the best deals in the city. There are not alot of places where you can get the service and quality of a three star restaurant for these prices. (Entrees being no more than $20) There's almost always a wait but you could get lucky like us, only 15 minutes when they fore casted 1hr and a half."
0,"I decided to try the original Bubby's last Friday, I was in a business meeting in Tribeca so I strolled in there for lunch after my meeting. I did have a bad experience at their Brooklyn location few months back but I was willing to give them a second chance.   Service: slow and very careless (took 15 mins to order and another 15 for my lemonade and than 20 mins after that my food came out). Thank god I was by myself. Food: old and stale bun on my burger, cold french fries and my burger was over cooked (I ordered medium rare and it was cooked all the way through). What is the point of waiting for them to ask me how my meal was and than wait more time for them to remake it. On top of it my lunch with tip, tax and everything about $45 (that is insane this day and age). what a disappointment, the cherry on top of the cake was, I noticed that they were getting their health inspection from the DOH, guess what? today I decided to check the DOH web site and they got 49 points in violations. I had a bad feeling about Bubby's and it got confirmed again. Good luck to all the other yelpers, dine in this establishment at your own risk."
0,"Words can't express how good the food is here! We had the special which was Duck that day and a spinach pasta with chicken dish - both Aaammmmmmmaaazziinnngggg!!! Finger licking, tasty, left us wanting more. Dessert - my first time having a cannoli - I cleaned the plate, and we also had their cheesecake - light a fluffy so cleaned the plate. Just excellent food all round!"
0,"Broncos is without a living doubt the BEST taco place ever. Forget about Taco Bell, Broncos has absolutely authentic tasting tacos. My mouth still waters thinking about their steak tacos...."
1,"I came here for dinner with some girls friends one night and had an excellent time. The service was prompt and friendly, we had lots of questions about the menu and our waitress answered them all. We were very appreciative that they took our reservation for 6 over the phone less than 2hrs before we wanted to sit, and this was a Friday night.   I had the homemade gnocchi which was incredible! So light but also savory and filling, doesn't sound possible but it was just that. I would go back again for sure!"
1,"If you are a tourist in the Manhattan, come visit Lillie's! It is one of the most unique bars that I have ever been to. From the stain glass windows to the faucets in the restroom, everything in this restaurant reminds of Victorian era decor. There are even frescos on the vaulted ceilings. I only had drinks here so I really can't comment on their food. This place is more more than a bar/restaurant, it's an experience."
0,"There's a reason for the long lines but the despite the wait, the fresh and delicious quality of the food makes the wait worthwhile. Prices are reasonable but not ideal. Service can sometimes carry attitude but at the speed and volume of the server's days at this non-stop restaurant, one may cut them some slack and be back for more."
1,"If it wasnt for yelp im not sure I would ever eat at a Halal cart. Theres literally one on every street you walk on. This one was definitely crowded and you can tell that they prepare a bunch of meat, plates, bread to make the line grow so people know that they are the popular one. Myself and 2 of my girlfriends SHARED 1 combo plate: half gyro half chicken over rice. comes with lettuce and bread. ($6) We made sure to put the hot sauce and white sauce all over. BAD IDEA....... I got SO SICK from the hot sauce. was it the hot sauce or the food? Im not sure but I was IN SO MUCH PAIN. WATCH OUT FOR THE HOT SAUCE BECAUSE IT IS FREAKIN HOT!! so hot it ruined the rest of my day :( Dont think ill ever go back to a Halal cart. I want to barf everytime i walk by one."
0,"Where to begin!? I work in the Flatiron District and wanted to try something new. Barn Joo has been on my list of places to dine but never got the chance until the other day. After getting out of work early I decided to give their Happy Hour a shot. Best deal I've encountered yet. They have $1 oysters, $4 draft beer, $5 wine, $6 sangria, $7 specialty cocktails and food options. The best part of this deal is that it's every day! I tried their Smoked Manhattan and it was just decadent. A very well balanced drink that really speaks to the pallet. I've heard and read that they're wings, specifically their soy-garlic flavored wings, were really good so I had to give those a try. Trust me, it's something everyone should order. Juicy chicken on the inside and crispy yet nicely glazed on the outside. Even though it was busy, the bartender's were still able to make me feel acknowledged. Overall, a great experience on all levels. Will have to try their wheel of prizes next time I go!"
1,If only this place was bigger. Food is good- It should be a few bucks cheaper- &I'd go far more. Why do you feel the need to bring your children in such a small joint? All we want is to hang without your little one running around playing peek-a-boo. Maybe change up the menu a little more other than the specials? Put some summer tables outside?
0,Just drp[[ed in with friends while visiting NYC. Great foodm very lively atmsphere and good service. Nice for a drop in spontaneous munchie.
0,I would not come back for dinner.
1,I'm a fan! As you walk into this place it has a casual and inviting feel to it. Just like Philz. Its a humble no frills place- but the food is good - perfect langonisa or tocino breakfast. It heavy but it hits the spot when you need. Coming from the UWS not as easy to get to but worth the trip. Service is friendly as well. We took our 6 month old - and stroller and all - met friends for lunch and the staff were great about it - even though we took a little bit of room up. Will be back!
1,I was just a few hours there...and the duck lasagna and anything else on drinks was great. The waitress was super annoying....she was every ten minutes there whether we needed anything... almost like a robot with a set up time.. nor did she introduce herself..etc..
1,"Had a birthday dinner here. The chili lobster is by far the best item on the menu. Other items not as great ( seabass, cavatelli). Cavatelli was too salty ( and I can tolerate a lot of salt)! Really good service and delicious amuses brought to the table to start. Desserts are better than the entrees. Loved the blondie with marshmallow ice cream! Would come back for dessert but mot for dinner."
0,"The filet mignon was the best I've ever had! A little pricey, but the fast, friendly service and tasty food made up for it. Great ambiance too."
1,"Most of the time, unless you go during off hours, you wait forever for a table, get seated next to slobbering strangers, then get rushed out the moment you're done with your last bite. But being treated like such crap has never felt so worth it because those soup dumplings are soooooo good. I've definitely eaten fourteen or fifteen in one sitting, which is kind of gross (but it felt so right at the time!). If you've never tried them yet, just get up and go now. They're like heaven in a bamboo steamer."
1,Omfg...Best steak tartare I ever had. Scampish pasta was light and really good. Beets were incredible. Complimentary foccacia bread sprinkle in lemon zest was delicious.
0,"Excellent delivery.  Quick, well packaged and delicious."
0,"Really like this place! Great drinks, meatballs and drunken prunes. The atmosphere is pretty hipster but laid back so nothing is in your face, which is nice. Looks like  a great neighborhood place, my new go-to spot"
1,"Fact: Al Sharpton is probably not appetizing. He looks like he would be very salty. Fact: The Al Sharpton at Amy Ruth's is delicious! I have never had Chicken & Waffles. Why would I? I mean, who would even think that it's a good combination? Oh, how naive I have been. Wasting precious time which could've been spent eating at Amy Ruth's! The waffle was perfect: fluffy, light tasting, but able to hold onto the maple syrup without getting soaky and squishy (yes, ""squishy"" is a culinary term used in the description of waffles.) I had smothered chicken b/c I think chicken is dry otherwise and it was good. We didn't wait long because we missed the church and brunch rush and were too early for the dinner wait and the service was good, towards the end the waitress disappeared, which I always find annoying but I wasn't in a rush so I shouldn't complain. I also learned from the man at the door (who the hell is this guy?? doorman? host? bouncer?) that he doesn't like scary movies."
1,"Wonderful service, adorable place, food great with a couple of misses. The chicken is fabulous. I almost never get chicken in restaurants but I had a feeling about this one -- it's a half chicken, broken out flat with the crispest skin you could possibly imagine. It also comes with Brussels sprouts and potatoes that soak up the chickeny sauce. The lamb shank, though gorgeous on the plate, is not all it appears -- it's relatively dry, we expected juicer. The whole fish was also pretty low on flavor, though the right texture and moisture level. Lobster risotto that comes with the fish is delicious."
1,Picked this place because of the Yelp reviews. Thank you everyone I loved it! Try the Gnocci with sage mmmmmmmmm
1,"My girlfriend and I were making our way back to the Bronx from IKEA, carrying a large, heavy, package. Wanted to eat and thought that the area beside South Street Seaport would have lots of options. Had not realised that Hurricane Sandy had taken a huge toll on that neighbourhood but fortunately stumbled across Fresh Salt which proved to be a great find. The sandwich menu is very interesting and it took a while for us to come to decisions but we finally settled on an appetiser of 3 cheeses with pesto grilled on pita, which we shared. Sue decided to have turkey sandwich with a side salad - I forget what accompanied the turkey but she said it was delicious. I had a kind of BLT with what was described as 'spec' which was like crispy bacon but with no fat, served on some kind of crispy Italian bread with avocado and chipotle mayonnaise. I will admit that I was ravenous, it was my first meal of the day, but it was delicious and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it as much if I was less hungry. The chipotle mayo was just a tiny bit spicier than I would have preferred - the heat was just enough to detract from the flavour of the ham and avocado but not enough to rob Fresh Salt of a star. The kettle-cooked, salt and vinegar flavoured potato chips were a tasty reminder of English pubs in years-gone-by. I did not do the place justice in washing down the food with diet coke but I'm not about to take up drinking again just for the sake of getting material for a comprehensive yelp review. Sue was still waxing lyrical about the grilled 3-cheese pita appetiser a full 24 hours later. Nice place, friendly barman and good atmosphere. Highly recommend."
0,"Don't need to bother going there. Unless you are not hungry and have too much money to waste. In this place, almost nothing is right. Trust me, they forced you to order for 2 people, hot pot, but it's not even enough for one, and it's not even half good as the shabu shabu we ate elsewhere. the  only reason I give one star is because the green tea ice cream at end which come w/the order is very delicious."
1,"Lucali's hasn't missed a beat. We tried to get to the restaurant right at opening and there already was an hour wait. It was worth it. We got two pies for the four of us, and as always, the pies were excellent. The staff was kind enough to stage the pies, providing our mushroom pie first, and then out 1/2 pepperoni / 1/2 pepper/onion pie.  The quality of the pies and ingredients were exceptional. As usual, Lucali's continues to be byob. Awesome place."
1,Oh my god...it was not large porpotion...it was HUGE porpotion....If there are only two of you...don't go to this place.....anyway...good service...delicious food......just remember to bring more friends with you.......
1,"Wow, this space sure is perty. Sky lights, old money meets modern decor, fancy drinks, and plenty of old school whimsy is what you can expect from this new lil' critter in Lennox Hill (or Upper East Side, whatever you prefer). It's just getting its sea legs now, but I'm really looking forward to seeing how this wet behind the ears pup grows into a full grown animal. #beastmode."
0,$1 for 5 dumplings which you receive five seconds after you order them. If you happen to be in front of me on line please have a dollar bill because there's nothing I hate more than waiting for dumplings while you get back $19 in singles.
0,Def. one of a kind location. Been here over a handful of times as a snack. The sauces never seem to amaze me. So creative and fun and who doesn't love thick Belgium fries?!
1,SLAMMMMMMING!! ok ok now this is one of my spots to go to in harlem! i love it. this is awesome soul food! every time i come here i usually get the dougie fresh which is the Waffles & Fish combo.  The fish is a whiting and its very nice! you get some good ol corn bread to eat as an appetizer before your meal comes! i love coming here i need to take a trip over there soon! i say anyone who wants some delicious food come here!! very good :)
0,"Hand's down, the best pizza I have evr tasted."
0,"When my husband and I first stumbled upon Ngam this past summer, we were so happy to find a restaurant that served delicious Thai cuisine at such a reasonable price point.  The night we dined there, they were offering $6 grilled lobster tails! And they were darned good too.   It was a no brainer when I was picking a venue for my birthday party dinner this October.  While most restaurants in NYC make it extremely difficult to book large party reservations, Chef Hong, Molly and team made it easy and were so accommodating.   They worked within our budget and created a tasty crowd-pleasing menu.  We started with fresh oysters for the table served with a spicy thai sauce.  Our guests had a choice of  a garden salad, spring rolls or tom kha soup to start.  The choices for mains were the Thai Burger (unlike any burger I've ever had - it's delicious), pad thai and green curry.  The green curry was very spicy but my friends raved about it. We were also able to bring in our own birthday cake which was nice. The dinner was relaxed and fun and we never once felt rushed.  We were able to take over the entire communal table in the center of the restaurant.   The service at Ngam is exceptional whether you're going on a date or throwing a bday dinner for 22 people.  I can't say enough good things..."
0,"Especially for the price, that was one of the best chicken breast sandwiches that I've ever consumed. The roll type bun put it over the top. The flavors were delicious. Next visit, I will try the mac-and-cheese and the burger."
1,"This place is AWESOME! My sweet husband took me here for my birthday dinner last weekend and immediately upon entering the restaurant I couldn't wait to explore it. Drink list is creative, bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly, wait staff was on top of things. The place was pretty empty when we arrived at 6 for our reservation, and that was fine with us. We pushed back our reservation to 6:30 and then 7 due to the fact that we were enjoying a few drinks in the bar and chatting with the bartender. The hostess and wait staff were happy to move our reservation to 7 for us.   When we finally decided to sit down for dinner, we ordered the Tomahawk steak for two and it was just the right size for us (and we are big steak eaters). I can't describe how it is served without creating a ""that's what she said"" situation but it was cooked to our liking on the inside (medium rare) and perfectly blackened/crispy on the outside. We also had a house salad and another salad-y appetizer that was served on a flaky, crusty bread that was just ok (the salad was good but the flaky thing was bland and perhaps random) but we weren't there for the salad. The dining rooms make you feel like you are sitting in a movie set for a George Washington-era flick, with large, flickery candles, gorgeous wood floors and large wood tables in the center of the room. The place started to get a bit crowded around 8ish, and with a few tourist-y looking people, but that was ok. After dinner we returned to our comfy spot at the bar on the left side of the restaurant for a couple more drinks, as we couldn't get enough of the atmosphere and ambiance of this place. Oh, and there was a two-man band there that night, which was quite enjoyable. Needless to say I can't wait to go back and plan to sooner rather than later."
0,"This place is excellent. They have great wine and food. I went here as a first date with an old boyfriend. I am glad he introduced me to the place because I continued to go after we broke up.  May be a little weird to have one of your favorite places inrtoduced by someone you despise the most (Internal Laugh). I would reccomed this place to any and everyone. They have great service, prompt and effecitive. The crowd there was nice the times I've went there. The prices are excellent for the great quality food. So make sure you leave the cheap buckets at home if you're coming to this place. Hoep this review helps!"
1,"i did AND dined.  last night to be specific.  and had quite the enjoyable meal.  somewhat skittish at first since the night's menu seemed to be pretty seafood/fish-heavy (friendly warning to fellow allergy sufferers), but thankfully, the ""safe"" options were all kinds of lovely (looking and tasting!).  for apps, we (group of 4 - helps to dine with at least this many people so as to make better inroads into the various offerings) split the fois gras doughnut (haters, don't be hating), the potsticker natchos and the spicy smoked corn chowder; all yum.  and then came the entrees: fish and chips (obviously, not my idea), the beef tenderloin and the roast chicken; again, yum.  mine (chicken) was best, as evIdenced by the fact that EVERYONE picked the plate clean.  i think it may have something to do with the fact that the chicken sat atop a delicious heap of sweet corn succotash.  oh joy.  and for desert, s'mores, blow-torched tableside by one of the very friendly waitstaff.  maybe too gimmicky, that bit, but kinda funny too.  the only real downside to the evening was the messy rain that prevented us from dining al fresco in what looked to be a lovely backyard.  next time.  happy to welcome yet another fine and fun dining experience to the neighborhood.  gentrification, not so dirty a word."
1,"Went here for my bday. The place has a nice ambiance and  feels cozy. Their red wine selection  is just alright; nothing that stands out. Mostly Argentinian Malbecs and a couple of California and Italian wines. Waitstaff was nice enough but over eager service....they would come by every 2mins to fill up an almost full glass of water and what's worst, they kept topping off our wine glasses even though they were full. I know why they do it. I was a waiter back in the day. Pushing wine in this way is tacky and very off putting. A great waitstaff is invisible discreet and effective. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh expecting this type of service at Porteño, but come on this is New York and at their price point I would certainly expect a lot more. The food I have to say that my friend and I came with lots of expectations. Based on the reviews but the food fell waaaayy short of what we expected. For aps we ordered empanadas. I had the spinach and the beef. The beef was not bad but certainly not something I would rave about: the spinach however was bland. It tasted like a a frozen spinach hot pocket. Quite bad. For our main my friend ordered the pork chop and I had the rib eye. I must say the rib eye was well cooked (I asked for medium) but again it was very bland and tasteless. Also it was so thin I thought they had made a mistake with my order. I just have never had such a thin piece of rib eye for $30!!!! Are you kidding me? I know you got to turn a profit  but this is ridiculous. If you go there ask them how thick the  steak is. You'll see what I mean.   The rib eye was served with chimichurri which was really not bad and with a warm kale and bean salad. I love kale and white beans and have to say this was pretty ordinary. My friend said his pork chop was just ok....from my end it looked good, nice and thick in a bed of mashed potatoes but I did not taste it. We did not stay for dessert. We knew better. I have to say, I'm an above average cook and pretty decent food connoisseur . This is not my first Argentinian restaurant.....I want to ask Porteño, how can they serve this type of basic argentine cuisine and do such a terrible job at it? I could have made our entire meal at home with much better results...not trying to brag but it blows my mind that a place in NYC can serve this and still be around.....only time will tell. Is not about fancy it's about good honest food and Porteño most certainly lacks that. I would not waste my money there. There are plenty of good Argentinian restaurants in Manhattan and the buroughs."
1,"Limitless joy awaits all those who brave the wait at this mega trendy soba joint to order the silky tofu, the bacon-infused mochi (!), and absolutely any dip soba whatsoever. The Mera Mera Dip Soba is probably my favorite noodle dish in all of NYC. The Kimchi Dip is also yummy as can be. Anyway, what makes Cocoron so horrendously ill is that the noodle quality and the broth quality and the seasoning quality are all equally high. Honestly, I don't even understand how they can sell some of their sides, like this one really stunning kimchi, for just like two or three bucks and still stay open. So yeah, if you look at what I wrote above you probably already know what comes next. This place gets capital c, Crowded. No matter how many waiters they employ stuff would still get nuts in here. Honestly, the service here has always been amazing for me and the waitresses fight bravely against the non-stop onslaught of starving soba-fiends. Cocoron is a place one doesn't really want to write Yelp reviews about in fear of making it yet more crowded and popular and nuts. But y'know what? After eating way too much Mera Mera, chicken meatballs, and sticky mochi here last week, I honestly feel there should be like five of these in Manhattan alone. So people, rock this place."
1,"Went back one last time before leaving NYC and this is the best in class.  I've been to Mighty Quinn's, Briskettown, Daisy Mays, Dino BBQ etc. and this place is still #1.  The only thing I don't like is long wait to get food."
0,"Recently-opened cafe on the edge of Carroll Gardens, in the old Crave storefront. Quiet and lovely ambiance, with old photos of the owner's family covering the walls and that dressed-up-old-school vibe. Nice place to get some work done, or to just have a coffee with a friend. Food menu seems to be a bit limited now, but their lattes are fantastic, as are their other espresso drinks. I'm obsessed with the pressed salami & cheddar croissant sandwich. Butter scones are great, too. This is a great little spot that is deserving of our patronage! Though I appreciate there's always plenty of room in which to sit, I'd like word to catch on that this place is worth a visit."
0,"Amazing! Great atmosphere, food and Sangria!!"
0,"Had a yummy brunch here on Sunday. Boyfriend had an oyster omelet which he loved, and I had an eggs Benedict dish with kale and butternut squash. So nice to eat somewhere for brunch that has relatively healthy, meatless options that extend beyond yogurt and granola, so thank you! I think they just opened for brunch and are still working out the service kinks.. there weren't that many people in there and the busser had a hovering issue, which is annoying when you are trying to just chill out with your eggs and your hangover. There's also a pretty bad beer smell, but it's a bar so what can you do. It will be really nice in the spring when they open up those windows. A great addition to the hood."
1,"I don't normally take to Yelp to write a review unless I'm utterly blown away by a place or utterly disappointed, and while I would have given the restaurant a 4 based on their food, the way our party of 11 was handled after an error from our waitress made the restaurant lose some of its charm. We went to Uva on 11/23/13 for a friends party. We were a group of 11. We waited for a little for a table even though there was a reservation and our party was all on time, but that's no matter, It is to be expected in NYC restaurants and our wait was not terribly long. We were seated in the downstairs area which was nice and cozy and away from the crowd. When the waitress came, we asked upfront about having separate tabs. Restaurants in NYC that cannot accommodate separate tabs annoy me- Why? Because I have been both a waitress and a bartender and I know for damn sure on POS systems checks can indeed be split- and quite easily might I add. So when a restaurant is reluctant to- I know it's because they don't WANT to, not because they CAN'T. Our waitress however, agreed to split our tab because we were a group of couples. The drinks were flowing- no challenge there, but even a bread basket took awfully long to make its way to our table. The bread literally came right before the appetizers. I had the Polenta and sampled other appetizers. I loved the calamari and the shrimp skewers. In between appetizers and dinner however- the wait was long. Our reservation was for 8:30, we were seated around a quarter to/ 9-ish- we did not eat dinner until well after 10. Still- we were reasonable. But then came the check. The waitress brought us one whole check together. When a friend (the person whose birthday we were celebrating)  asked what happened to the separate checks the waitress said ""I couldn't keep track of what everyone ordered."" That annoyed me because if you agreed to separate our checks you should have kept track- is it that difficult to write on separate sheets of paper old school style? That's another thing I know about POS systems- you can open separate bills for seats that literally mimic the table and you can keep track of what each customer eats and drinks. It's not that difficult- and its part of what you get tipped for. Moving on- we agree to do an even split- we divided the check 10 ways (minus the bday girl), some people paid with cash, some with credit card. After running our tabs through, some members of our party left and the waitress tells us ""I'm sorry I made a mistake that's not your tab you just paid someone else's bill- yours is $150 higher."" WONDERFUL. Since 4 people already left. Needless to say, the birthday girl became irate and told them it was their error and we had already paid and we were not paying the new tab. Obviously members of our party disagreed with her and we tried to calm her down and rectify the mistake. The manager who came to fix the dilemma started saying things like ""what do you mean you aren't paying it. You have to"" when my friend pointed out that members of our party were gone she said ""only 4 people left"". That's nice lady- but we had already split the check so the extra charge fell on the people who remained. To make matters worse, being compliant, we agreed to have the restaurant reverse the previous charge and recharge the higher bill. Except they did not. I was charged twice. They never credited back the money from the incorrect charge. A dinner that was $120 cost my husband and I $240. I had to call my bank the next day and have them reverse the pending charge but I still have to call the restaurant and have them fix it on their end. And all because the waitress could not figure out how to keep track of peoples tabs. I worked for many years in the hospitality industry. The customer is never wrong. I have dealt with snobby, nasty people who were downright wrong and marveled at the service my managers provided. ""Sorry for our error- here's a round of drinks on us"", ""or you know what, we will take that off the check."" It was the waitresses mistake- they should have done something to accommodate us after their error. Something to reverse the bad taste their service left in our mouth. We live in 2013- people go out in groups...people pay with credit cards...your registers are touch screens...figure out how to split a damn check already. Also- figure out how to reverse a bad charge. I did it all the time and I did it immediately when I bartended. Takes two seconds. I also rectified any errors I ever made with a smile on my face, an apology, and an incentive to make the customer return despite my guffaw- we received neither of the three at Uva."
1,"Went here for a special occasion, was all hyped and excited to go all out. Unfortunately, my high expectations were not met. First of all, the attitude of our waitress was completely off-putting. As soon as we sat down, she asked if we were there for the burgers. Rather, she ASSUMED and made this judgement aloud. When in fact, we were there for just the opposite. We wanted to try the dry aged cote de boeuf for two with roasted marrow bones. After treating us like the riff raff, you would think she would apologize for having made this error in judgement. And you would be wrong, she continued treating us like the riff raff after we ordered the most expensive thing on the menu. Second, I wasn't overly impressed with my the food & drink. Cocktail glass was small and the drink wasn't the best I've ever had. Same with the food, actually. The cote de beouf was too rare and chewy for my taste, the marrow bones were spongue-like and lacked a good flavor (though I'll admit I hadn't had marrow bones in the past). The most promising part of the meal was the sides. We got pommes aligot, carrots, and spinach, all of which I loved. The carrots were truly incredible, possibly the best served carrot dish I've ever had. It's too bad the rest of the meal didn't follow suit. Maybe we should've gone with the burgers, after all."
1,"Uber Cool Plus Good Food makes for a great Combo. Awesome Vibe with Good Music, Food, Ambiance and Hip Crowd. Try The Grilled Corn w/Cheese, ""It's Off The Chain"" !!!"
1,"Totto Ramen certainly is the best ramen shop in NYC. The flavor in the broth are myriad and deep, while the textures of the noodles and meat leaves you wanting more."
0,"Worst restaurant in the city! The food was terrible, it had no flavor. The French fries were so over cooked they were impossible to eat and when we told the waitress she went and told the chef sitting at the bar and he dismissed it with a rood hand motion. The service was exceptionally bad. When we asked the waitress to clear our plates she answered: ""don't you see what I'm doing, I'm picking it up now."" In addition she was never there when we needed something. When you spend 140 dollars you expect more. A piece of advice do not spend ur time or money at Landmarc."
0,"The only bad thing about freemans is that its not near where I live. I love every bartender there. They have great cocktails and not cocky about it like other cocktail lounges.  Food is awesome and the surroundings are amazing. Stuffed animals everywhere. I would say go check this place out, but anyone who has not been here is not a real New Yorker."
0,"very good food, very cheap and good service."
1,"You know something must be up if a spot approaches 1K reviews... This is a takeout joint, nothing more besides the ""browse our jewelry while you wait"" counter. You go in, put in an order (stick with numbers unless your Cantonese is rapid fire), maybe throw in overpriced hip drinks like fizzy water stuff, and be on your way in less than 10 minutes. The BBQ pork (chaa siu in Canto, cha shao in Mando) Banh Mi rightly occupies first place on the menu. For me, the BBQ pork addition is what makes this stand out from other banh mi spots, probs because chaa siu tastes like home. Regardless, a stuffed baguette sandwich at $4.50--large enough for me to last two days--and you're a golden buddha rubbing a happy belly! Their non-late night hours work against them, though. When my cravings hit, I must search elsewhere after 6pm :("
0,"Came in on Monday night on a rezzy with 8 others for my birthday. We were sat immediately, though our party wasnt yet complete. We went in for the ""Bo Ssäm"". We also ordered the pork buns, tripe, oysters with Thai basil, finchville farms ham,  Edwards wigwam ham, honey crisp apple kimchi, diver scallop with Meyer lemon, the Santa Barbara uni... I think that's it. Pork buns are never a disappointment, Edwards wigwam ham was frigging wonderful,  honey crisp apple kimchi was tits,the oysters with Thai basil were nice, diver scallop was a miss, the uni dish was delicious but the uni gets kinda lost. Now the main attraction, Bo Ssäm... Holy fuck that's a shit load of meat. It comes with all the necessary accoutrements. Kimchi, soybean paste, Bibb lettuce, scallion, etc... Fucking great, expensive, but it fed all 9 of us, and was worth it. We got the giant ""s'more"", ganache, and lebne ice-cream. Apart all the elements of the s'more were whateves. But, all together were fan""fucking""tastic. We were never looking around for our server. She was right there whenever we lifted our heads for a refill or pretty much anything. The kitchen staff seemed cool and in control of everything, no loss of composure even when they got really really busy. Big ups to the momofuko crew for putting on a great meal!!! I'll be back for the monster ribeye that I was eyeball fucking from were I was seated"
0,Could make a meal of the sides alone.
1,"Mmmm. Burgers delish. I actually don't like their briochey buns very much but that's not enough to keep me away. The onion rings are not awesome (and overpriced if you ask me) but the burger was spot on. Good job Royale! Boyfriend loved his Bacon Royale and, upon biting into it, gave me The Look -- the one I had previously thought was reserved for behind closed doors but ... well, I appear to have been sadly mistaken. Oh, and if you go to the bathroom ladies, make SURE the lock catches. I got walked in on. Whoops!"
0,Excellent! I had the octopus as an appetizer which was delicious and the spiced duck breast. I thought it was quite good but I tried a piece of my father's capretto- that was three times better! Instead of dessert I had grappa.... if you like sweet grappa I would highly recommend their cherry and almond grappa- delicious!
0,"I'd been hearing about this place FOREVER, so I decided to finally drop in and see what the fuss was all about. Let me tell you, I'm glad I did. This spot is the BEES KNEES, YO. I ordered the naked meatballs with the parmesan cream sauce. WHOA, NELLY. If you've ever wanted to know what a full service shiatsu massage to your taste buds feels like, you have to order the parmesan cream sauce. You know why McGruff took a bite out of crime? Because it was smothered in that life changing condiment of wonder. BUT WAIT. You won't believe this, but the best part of my day happened AFTER I exited this establishment of fine dining. I had an appointment with the peeps at TinderHeadshots.com. I wanted to get some grade A, professional photos for my Tinder profile, because the one I have now where I'm petting my orange tabby, Mr. Snugglesworth, gives off an evil genius, I plan to take over the world vibe. When I got there, I had that delicious, delicious parmesan cream sauce dripping down my face. You know what these cats at Tinder Headshots did? They wiped it off my chin. They made me look like a presentable human being. Crazy, right? Did I mention the tasteful cardigan I had on was DRENCHED in that awe inspiring parmesan cream sauce? I wanted to keep it on during the photo shoot and just suck on the collar between set ups. THEY WERE HAVING NONE OF THAT. These dudes helped me into some new threads, and had me looking like a Don Juan at senior prom. Once I score a hot date on Tinder using these photos, I'm bringing my new lady friend to the Meatball Shop!"
1,"This cute tiny place let me experience my first Tarte Flambee. For those that haven't tried it before, it's a thin crust (like matzoh) with slightly sour cream and whatever topping you choose. If you are smart you will choose cheese...mmmm. I had the gruyere, caramelized onion and leeks flambee. It was delish. I would say my one complaint is that it was crusty - the topping did not reach the borders of the crust so I had some extra crust leftover with no toppings. There are signs that let you know that no forking is allowed ie you eat with your hands. I want to go back to try the sweet ones."
0,We ordered Pizza here for our holiday party. I was amazing! I was surprised because we ordered pepperoni and they were soo incredibly small but tasted so good we didnt even mind. Crust was okay and the salad was very good.
1,"Having just returned from Tokyo, we were cautiously optimistic in our search for a local spot that would offer the same kind of intimate, Japanese dining experience so easily found on that small island but less so on our island. Hakata did not disappoint. In fact, it proved to be every bit as authentic as the eateries we found in Tokyo. Petite in size, Hakata offers a selection that is a quite comprehensive. We had the chives hot pot, which was perfect for a cold, winter evening, followed by the sesame ice cream/creme brulee. The soup broth was full of flavor and satisfyingly oily. An abundance of vegetables made me feel less guilty about my choice of dish. A couple dabs of yuzu sauce gave the flavor even more depth. Do yourself a favor and try the sesame ice cream--it's one of the best I've had. The friendly waitress made our night by thanking us a million times. I felt an urge to return her hospitality by bowing repeatedly. Hakata made me so nostalgic for Japan. If only I could fly over every weekend without breaking my back and my piggy bank. For now though, Hakata will cure my cravings."
1,"Best thing to do here is come early for brunch, sit at the bar or by the windows, bask in the sunlight, the paper and an espresso (a bloody mary may be substituted, or both). All the brunch items are pretty delicious, as it is in the afternoon or dinner, although I prefer Bocca Lupo during the day. There's something about the light that feels a little magical. The staff here is really sweet and friendly - I've been regaled with tales of Cobble Hill History and also randomly asked them to hold a package once while I went back to the city to pick up my keys - the bartender let me do so with great kindness and empathy. Lovely, slightly off the beaten path spot in the hood."
0,"Awesome food, lively atmosphere, good service. A satisfying meal guaranteed."
1,"Overall this place lived up to its expectations.  The food was delicious, and the environment is great.  Not to mention they have a great selection of whiskeys and beer.  A little expensive, but i promise you wont leave hungry."
1,Great food! Very flavorful dishes. Only been there once but will go back.
0,"The Butcher steak is the one to go with.  Only 15 bucks and it has a world of flavor.  I can't give 5 stars though because they only offer rib eye besides this steak.  Other than that, the beer list was really long and the owner or manager guy was really cool about talking about his favorites.  He also talked about the latest wines that arrived, but I'm not a wino.   This spot is mad cool - has it's own cool vibe.  It feels like a bar instead of a restaurant which makes it a fun place and not so stuffy at all."
1,Stopped by here with 2 friends recently. Blew me away. I had the shrimp pasta and bronto burger and wow... I'm not sure what it is but the quality of the food is very high and tastes amazing. Almost reminded me of asian food. A must eat in NYC. (they're expanding next door I think as well).
1,"I really enjoy this place. I take a lot of my friends who are visiting the city to this place just because a lot of them have food phobias. The menu is set up like Barbie Sketch Portfolio. Depending on how hungry you are you can order accordingly. If you don't do spicy, forget that Spicy Pork on your laminate menu. Hate cheese? Don't let your dry erase marker near that category. Loathe the pleasure of a perfectly fried egg nestled on your sandwich, No Family Jewels for you! I love it. I don't have to hear my friends nag how they hate something (I imagine this is what having a girlfriend must feel like) or it could be the complete opposite where we all order something different and cut it into threes and pass your plate clockwise. The communal meal: Spicy Pork, Classic Tomato, The Family Jewels, Mozzarella (fried egg) Brioche with a arugula salad Special: Buffalo Wing, Spicy Blue Cheese, Blue Cheese, Provolone Classic Beef, Classic Tomato with Mushrooms, Mozzarella PBRs"
1,"I was visiting in NYC and decided to give this place a shot.  The xiao long bao weren't too bad and I am a bit biased since I prefer dumplings from the northern part of China.  With that being said I gave this place an extra star for their XLB, however everything else was pretty terrible.   General Tso's chicken was more like orange chicken you can find at Panda Express and the Garlic Scallop and Shrimp had barely any flavor.  I forgave the fact that the place was not that clean and that we sat next to the trash as it is packed and super busy, but was so disappointed in the food.  Panda Express food for anything but Panda Express prices and I hate Panda Express.  The spring rolls should just be called  fried eggroll skins because their was literally nothing inside and the scallion pancakes were oily and soggy when they should be light on the oil, crispy on the outside, and layered goodness on the inside.   I try to be gentle on Chinese dining since there are so many regions and specialties, but this place is a tourist trap.  I would agree with many of the reviews only order the XLB and if you are used to amazing XLB then just go somewhere else all together.  This place is not worth it at all."
1,"Great food and lovely cocktails.  I had the chicken spaetzle and my 2 guests had mussels and burger. I really like the beautiful bar reflected in the mirrored back wall and the dark intimate setting with candles. The only issue is that it's so tiny! And you really have to squeeze into their tiny tables and chairs. Not saying I'm chubbs, just sayin. I would like to go back soon."
1,"With a ton of brunch places in the city, it's hard to stand out with your food alone. Penelope managed to simplify the brunch menu into a few pre fixe selections with the combination of a tasty mimosa or the standard coffee/juice for $14. The wait was a little bit long, but that's usually a good sign for the food. The interior was a casual set up, nothing too fancy, but very homey. Waiter was friendly. I got the omelette with your choice of 3 ingredients, I got cheese, bacon and mushroom. Now brunch places usually give you a big generous portion, but also charge a pretty generous price. I thought the portion was perfect and the fries that came with it were very well done. If you're looking for something cheaper, my friend got the penny sandwich with the croissant and he liked it a lot also. Definitely a good place for brunch that's reasonably priced."
0,"although I don't like the meat packing district, this is a great reason to come to this side.  great experience.  Will love to come back and taste everything."
0,had breakfast arepa on saturday with a deliciously sweet sugar cane drink.  i was satisfied and buzzing for the rest of my day! glad caracas is in the hood!  really affordable too.
1,"I love this place!!!! The food is sooo good, the ribs fall off the bone omg you need to go I have not had a bad meal at all whether its a lunch, brunch or dinner."
0,Excellent tacos. Definitely coming back.
0,"It was saturday night and we waited for half hour. It wasnt  that bad. While we were waiting we looked over the menu. There are alot of snack. To save time, we wrote down what we want and gave it to the waitress when seated. The best items out of all the choice are the short rib and wasabi octopus. Some others dont serve with sauce.( Need improvement on it) Overall was a good experience! ^_^"
1,"Still love there steak and sides, admittedly, BUT the no reservations system and cold hearted hostess will prevent me now from returning.  Went early at 6:30 anticipating a wait, hoping to hold a table for 7:30, but was told to come back in 20 minutes, that there wasn't a list because there wasn't a wait.  Went back at 7 (30 minutes) and the wait was 1 hour 45 minutes.  So, be prepared to wait in order to wait.   The woman was callous about it, too.  I'm so over the ""tough shit"" attitude at hipster joints.  That said, went to Rye instead where they are very friendly and have a ribeye that is even better that St. Anselm's bone in."
0,"Overall I thought that Emporio was on, maybe, the high side of poor, and frankly, I'm shocked at the suspiciously over-the-top positive reviews here. My pasta (Forget the name of the dish, but it was the special) was actually undercooked to the point of being UNCOOKED. It was actually laughable. Our server was very apologetic and said that it had a recurrent problem (!!??) that night, and that she would get another dish. The substitution was a pasta dish with a cream-based sauce, and it was bland and kind of gooey. One look in the display kitchen reveals that all the food is being cranked out at lightening pace by a bunch of kids (and I mean that almost literally) with no apparent supervision. In my opinion, Emporio is just another money-making ""machine"" restaurant, cranking out mediocre food at reasonable-enough prices. When a restaurant is just about the bottom line, the food suffers horribly, and what you get is Emporio. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head saying that this place is just another novelty restaurant. Couldn't agree more, and won't ever be back."
1,"This place has been on my list forever but wow, I've definitely been missing out all these years.  We got the buckwheat spatzle and the emmentaler sausage...both strongly recommended.  Actually, everything here can probably be recommended and now I just need to get down here to try em all!"
0,"Ate here on Saturday night...drove all the way from Maryland to go to this place!  The food was awesome...I had the short rib and although it was a tad over cooked it was still one of the best short ribs I have had.  The company was amazing, the food fantastic, service was solid and the wine was excellent!"
0,"I always visit if in the mood for a hearty Polish meal especially potato pancakes. Great value for what you pay. Even though the interior is not very appealing, the staff is always pleasant and food tasty. After all, that's what matters."
0,"This is my favorite place in Astoria! I must eat from there about four times a week. They have the best quality for your money and the best coffee in Astoria. I love the Bresaola panini and the chicken with spicy mayo, and I can honestly say I've never had something off the menu that wasn't well put together. . . . The place just went through some changes that make it an even more awesome place, they got the most amazing cupcakes. I've had the oreo, caramel apple, red velvet, smores. . .  just to name a few; and the most exciting thing yet, they now have wine and beer!!! A friend and I had a bottle of the Juan Gil with our dinner and it was amazing. . .  Check it out!"
1,"it seems like every review here has given mountain province 5 stars, so i feel bad (just a tiny, tiny bit) breaking the trend. mountain province has a ton of seating, and a good number of outlets if you're looking for somewhere to do work. however, the coffee was average, lacking that thick, smoky flavor, and the pineapple scone i got wasn't that good. still, because it seems like every coffee shop in brooklyn is perpetually packed, the fact that mountain province was mostly empty and seems to be a largely undiscovered gem (it's also slightly out of the way of downtown williamsburg) makes it worth a second visit, and many more."
0,Very delish! We walked all the way there thru soho just to get to this pizza place! And let me tell you.....THE BEST PIZZA EVER!!! You MUST go!!
0,I wanted for the longest time to check out this cozy spot on Atlantic Avenue .. So finally I decided to make a reservation for my birthday .. Inspite of my party being late they held my reservation which I am very thankful :)   The food was amazing .. Tuna tartare and risotto top of my list not to mention  the beets & goat cheese The waitress was friendly as well as the host . Will be going back soon ! A million thanks you made my night very special
0,"The best sushi in NY! Have a seat at the sushi bar and learn how to eat the best sushi in NY! Try the yakisakana (grilled fish), and don't forget to try the skin!"
1,The Farm was greattt!!! Friendly service and very good food! We got here at the perfect time at 5:30pm and were the first ones to be seated. Dinner tonight made my day. The bread and olive oil was amazing. My friend and I had to ask for seconds. My burger and fries were perfect. The meat was juicy and thick. It was good on an english muffin. The fries were nicely seasoned. I do recommend the Butternut Squash Ravioli too. We didn't have room for dessert but I'm glad we decided to try it for dinner. Thanks for a great experience.
1,"Went around 11:45am on a Tuesday.  It was empty at that time so I had none of the wait issues that other people mentioned. (to go order was ready in about 5 minutes) I went for their lunch special -- 1/2 Classic Sandwich + House Salad + Iced Tea/Soda for $9 1/2 Original Sandwich + House Salad + Iced Tea/Soda for $11 I got a chicken salad sandwich on whole wheat; simple, but good and filling.  Not sure if it was a mistake, but they gave me a whole sandwich. yum! I also grabbed some whole wheat zucchini bread for later. Overall, good experience and would definitely come here again to try some of the more unique sandwiches. NOTE: you get 10% off bill with your Student ID"
1,"pros: It's a simple restaurant. I mean this in the best way possible. Both the atmosphere and food are pleasing and non-extravagant. There's no flourish; nothing is wasted. cons: It's a simple restaurant, and the portions, I am sad to say, were small. Our breakfast dishes were half salad leaves. While pretty on our plates, salad was supposed to be a side, not a main part of the meal. overall: The Farm may not be a place to go if you're 1. on a budget and 2. hungry. If neither of these conditions apply to you, this restaurant would be a pleasant place to have brunch. Enjoy the company of those around you and eat slowly so to stretch it out for as long as possible."
1,"I'm pretty stingy with handing out 5 stars because the place has to be pumping on all cylinders:  food, ambiance/atmosphere, cleanliness, and service. IMHO Hakata Ton Ton surpasses all of these. Since being introduced to the place a few weeks ago by a friend after an evening of heavy happy hour drinking, I've been here 3 times in 3 weeks. The place is tiny and always full. Reservations are advised although we were seated all three times. The first time, a waitress said they couldn't accommodate us. We were down the street and around the corner when another waitress caught up with us and asked us come back and we were seated immediately. That's 5-star service in my book! The Kyushu Japanese style food is simple and earthy, and the food at Hakata Ton Ton is based on the regional cooking of Hakata, Japan. That means pork pork pork. Even the restaurant's logo is a drawing of a cute pig snout. Make sure you order the Shabu Shabu hot pot with pork collagen broth. That doesn't sound appetizing, but it's better than saying pigs feet soup. It's delicious and everyone cooks their own pork slices and pork belly. Add the grilled pork belly skewer appetizer. You will not regret it. Tastier than bacon! Their sake and wine list is not extensive, but the most expensive wine is only $35 a bottle. You'll leave with a full, warm tummy. As you exit, the waitress will give you something extra to happily send you down the road."
1,"I used to work near this restaurant and have walked past the establishment countless times on my way to pick up a quick lunch at Wendys or McDonalds, but never tried it out until recently when a friend recommended it. I've aten at many Italian restaurants and this is as authentic as it gets. I had the grilled calamari and crapcakes to start... both amazing and the bucatina pasta as the main course. The pasta was obviously home made and the sauce with bacon had me from the first bite. Price was, it was reasonable... especially for the area. Too bad I don't work around there anymore!"
0,"Hands down, the best pizza in NYC. Totally worth the (sometimes) two hour wait. A little unsanitary, yes... but it's just too good to pass up. The pizza comes out of an 800 degree oven, so really, nothing to worry about. A party in your mouth if ever there was one. Worth the trip, worth the wait."
1,"I have tried Ding Tai Fung, both the original store in Taiwan and the one in  Glendale CA, and I have to say Joe's Shanghai's soup dumplings are much tastier.  The restaurant itself may not be as fancy as Ding Tai Fung's, but I am not there for the ambiance.   I have eaten at Joe's Shanghai for more than 10 times, and each time the dumplings have lived up to its reputation.  The crab pork meat dumpling is my favorite.  You have to eat them when they are fresh out of the steamer, otherwise the soup inside congeals and they don't taste as good. I have many friends and relatives that also have eaten at both Ding Tai Fung and Joe's Shanghai, and they all agree that Joe's soup dumplings are more flavorful, and tastier.  The only thing that Ding Tai Fung's dumplings are superior are they way they look right out of the steamer (they look much nicer than Joe's, but what do I care about how they look after they enter my mouth...). One of the times that I was there with my wife I accidentally left my wallet at home.  The waiter was nice enough to allow me to use my phone as a collateral and come back and pay for my meal.  I say this because some of the reviews speak poorly about the service.  I never had any bad experiences, and think that some of the reviews are due to cultural differences between Western and Asian cultures.  If you ever travel to China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan extensively you would know what I am talking about.   As for other items on the menu; they are good, but not the best Chinese food that I have ever eaten.  Don't get me wrong, I have always enjoyed Joe's food period, but having excellent food all over Asia, I know some of the menu items could taste better.  I would still eat at Joe's any day of the week, though."
0,"We have eaten here many times before and invited friends for their first visit. We have never been disappointed. Service and food are always exceptional. Owner truly want you to enjoy your meal. For an appetizer, try the artichoke fritters with gorgonzola dip...yummy..and a large enough portion to share!"
0,"don't go unless you want your burger bleeding rare or hockey puck overdone covered with blue cheese... they ""do not do substitutions"" and couldn't be ruder when telling you. worst experience in new york!"
1,"I was here for an birthday brunch.  The food was pretty good.  I had Eggs à la Norvegienne, which comes with smoked salmon.  It was delicious.  I ordered one dessert, & then ended up finishing a second dessert, but for some reason, I can't access the exact names of the dessert online & I don't have the receipt.  I had belgian waffles with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, & strawberries as my first dessert.  Then, the second dessert I finished appeared to be a chocolate ice cream with whipped cream.  The first dessert was really nice, I would get it again.  If I frequented the city more, I would definitely consider a return trip here."
1,Great food! Cheap easy and quick( if there's no line). Definitely must have when I visit the city.
0,This is WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT!!! Bonnie's is the best.  Nothing I could write could ever describe how well deserved all the praise is for this fantastic little place.  Diners all around NYC should aspire to be like Bonnie's.  You could have no taste buds and still find the food here to be incredible.
0,"Heard every one talking about this place. Was driving by and figured why not. Really nice place, good food. Price is good. I like it."
0,"I love the Boil! Delicious food, friendly service and a chill crowd. Very West Coasty and a must for people who love their shellfish as much as I do. Be prepared to get your hands dirty though and don't make any plans for after since you will be sure to want to waddle home and wash all the fish off. We had the soft shell crab to start which was just okay, then we shared bags of the Lobster, Shrimp, Crawfish and Dungeness Crab. The shrimp was my absolute favorite (suck the head!) but everything was delicious in that buttery garlicky old bay sauce. The corn and potatoes were also super flavourful in that sauce and the only thing I wished was that there was more of it. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get and I will definitely be back!"
0,Great food but as many have commented before the wait times are long.  We waited almost 3 hours for a party of 3 to get in.  The pancakes were delicious.
1,"Very cozy place, but the food can be better though. Draft beers are not bad, because they don't water down like other places. One complaint i have to make, The iky yaki (fried squid) was really salty. But I would definitely come back."
1,"dis place good. nice opportunity to get in touch with my flip side even tho im not. da balut my fav cause i grew up eating all of dat. but dat bird doe, can't get over da beak and eyes. dat kinda scare. mayne hole up tho. the service was bomb at first. then the waiter disappear. then his coworkers couldn't find him. then they try to hook us up with ice cream while we wait. then they charge us. it wasn't on da house! das why fo stahr, and not fai. da best dish is da fried rice. real garlic. real stank. don't kiss me bae. muah. lol."
0,"Balthazar, and all the McNally restaurants have long been at the top of our list, and we have been to them all. We returned for lunch and had a wonderful time. We were seated at one of our favorite banquettes, and the staff couldn't have been more attentive or friendlier. The food was as always, fantastic. Great oysters, escargot, duck shepherd's pie and their incredible lamb sandwich paired with a great bottle of Chablis."
0,Ate @ Table 87 2nite with my brother and coal pizza was so good I had to get on yelp and let everyone kno this was one of the best pizza I have had in very long time. Large pie was huge and brought 2 slices home DEFINITLY will come back. Thanks to Table 87
0,"This restaurant was recommended to me by a co-foodie.  It was the best meal I have had in about a year.  Pork buns were unreal, unbelievable yellow tail (hamachi carpaccio) and maguro sashimi apps.  The two of us shared the karaka-men with a poached egg on top.  It was suggested we order extra noodles if we had broth left over but we were stuffed by then.  Fantastic service, waiter was so enthusiastic about us having the right experience given that we were newbies!"
1,Best breakfast sandwich- the egg and pesto. Yum! Hard to eat and you kinda just have to lean against the wall to eat it. Or just walk away. BEST SHORTBREAD I've ever had in my entire life. Just get that and some coffee (Stumptown) and you will be super happy for the rest of your day.
1,"I'll open with a caveat - this is only 4 stars because I didn't get a chance to try their coffee. On an icy, slippery, rainy Sunday, I met my friends here for brunch. After a slow-paced and chilly walk, I was so relieved to be indoors. I got comfortable, noted the Bloody Marys my friends were drinking, and figured I'd have some coffee before getting crunk. Aita was having a problem with their water, so they couldn't make any coffee that day, but allowed me to dash across the street to Primrose Cafe and bring in a cup. Luckily, the rain had briefly stopped. But this isn't about that morning. This is just the context - if Aita had been terrible, this would be the start of a scathing review. But it was GREAT. Everything was delicious. The blueberry pancakes with lemon ricotta cream were sweet, savory, and perfect. The eggs (simple scrambled eggs!) were fluffy and buttery. The Bloody Mary made with their black peppercorn gin was spicy and refreshing. My friend moaned as he ate his omelet and we all agreed that the home fries were a cut above. Also, the service was excellent. Despite the plumbing issues, which apparently were on hold until we finished our meal (whoops), we were never once rushed. After we were moved to the bar so the plumbing could resume, they offered us cupcakes! If you twist my arm..."
1,"Cheap and delicious. Best value for money Absolutely fabulous. The gyros are exquisite. We've been ordering from this place almost every week for the last two months or so. It's quick, simple and delicious. And a gyro for under $4's. Ridiculous."
1,"I went last night with my boyfriend and we both got the New England Lobster Rolls. I could not believe how much lobster was in there! And big, big pieces of claw meat, too! The roll was toasted and buttery, it comes with a plentiful side of fries (you can sub salad) and fresh coleslaw. SO delicious. All that for $17. It was a way better value that some other, less lobster-y lobster rolls. We ate outside in the lovely patio area. Lots of seating, and I appreciated the available bottles of bug spray out there just in case. The selection of drinks is simple but pairs perfect with the food. We will definitely be going back."
0,My best friend visits every year and forces me to take her here every visit to see Frank at the bar.  He and the artichoke dip never disappoint.
0,"I wouldn't give this place 5 stars, but still a great place to eat. Service was extremely friendly, music was on point, and you can get most of the things on the menu and like it. Personally, I am a steak guy, and the short rib was excellent. If you are one of those people who like to share and hate only eating from one plate, this is undoubtedly the place for you. Recommend to most."
0,"This place is well worth stoppin by... This place is sexy, with dark corners to commit dark deeds... A deadly weakness in spite of overall strength, that can actually or potentially lead to downfall... It is very close to the water and it was once a watering hole for the dock men who worked on the East River. Now, it still is a watering hole, but for the tattooed hipsters, rockers, and cuties that inhabit the Republic of Brooklyn. A beautiful expansive bar, nooks and crannies to hold clandestine affairs, plank wooden floors, white plastered walls and even wooden crates full of fresh apples paints the picture here... Decent selection of cocktails and beers on offer here, but prices are on par to Manhattan standards... After you've taken your date to Paulie Gee's, come here and take aim with your most poisonous arrow..."
1,"I so so so wanted to really love this restaurant. Everything was just ok-- food, service, everything. Admittedly it was a Friday night, but still. We happily waited 40 minutes for a table- that is absolutely not a problem. When we finally sat down, our server was a real space case. He didn't do a great job, he was sort of confused and food didn't come out quite like it should-- one of us ended up eating their entree way after everyone else was done. No acknowledgement on the part of said spaced out server. It just wasn't what I'd call ""customer service"". Thomas Keller is big on the whole 'diner as guest, not customer' thing, and I have to day, there's something to be said for that. our $160 bill for 4 people was quite reasonable, except for the bum service and only OK food (we had mussels, fries, the trout, brussels sprouts). A+ for atmosphere."
0,The corn on the cob is great! I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on their fruity fresh beverages but they look good.   I love the festive decor and bright colors! It's great for the outdoor patio on a beautiful day (sun and birds are out). I always want to go dancing after I eat here at Habana Outpost because I get hype...Viva!
0,Took my family and friends last m ok nth. The food was really bad. The service wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend this place.
1,Came here for lunch with a friend. Their outdoor seating area in the back is open in the summer. Above average BBQ joint. Ordered the platter. Decent amount of food for 2 people. They gave us their apple cakes on the house. Awesome. Free food is always a win. Definitely had better BBQ elsewhere though.
0,Food is good but only one problem is long wait and a bit greasy .old man is know his craft.lots of people waiting  out.anytime I come I always get right.i highly recommended to give it try.
1,"I got the first item on the menu: Beef Hand Pulled Noodles ($5).  The broth was SO flavorful!  Way better than that bland, watered down stuff at not-so-Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles.  I almost wish the broth was weaker so that the flavor of the noodles was more pronounced.  There's a bit of a language barrier, so just tell them what menu item # you want when ordering."
0,"I've been coming to Le Barricou for years and can truly say it is one of the best restaurants in the whole of New York, no joke.  I've had better food and service here than most of the places I've visited in Manhattan and can attest to their even more extensive and eclectic collection of libations.  Take a look at the bar and marvel at how many choices they have, for a Williamsburg haunt?, this place is legit.  I've never seen so many different digestivs and aperitifs on a menu aside from Balthazar.  And what's more impressive is unlike Balthazar, this place has incredibly good prices for the quality and dare I say QUANTITY of incredible dishes they serve up.  I've rarely been able to finish my meals here, and not for lack of trying!  The service is bistro style and the place tends to fill up pretty quick, so for the amount of steps the servers actually go through, 8 specials, explaining cheese and wine pairings, running their own food and bussing tables for the most part, the servers and  their knowledge of the menu in my opinion is a level above any service I receive in Williamsburg (and even Manhattan, again, for that matter).   On that note, the food here is a process, as I've been told everything is fresh, made to order, and it's important to note that if you are in a huge hurry, this is not the place to pop in pop out when it's jumpin, unless you're having a sandwich or a burger or something little.  The kitchen is tiny you can walk by and peak in and they are making some serious culinary specialties back there!  Drink your bottle of wine and wait on busy nights like a Friday or Saturday...It'll be worth it.  The ambiance, really takes the cake.  I think I've actually fought people off for a space in the back lounge in front of a REAL wood burning stove in the winter time.  It's surreal to be there during the holidays as the owners really seem to take pride in creating a very special home away from home for their guests.  AND they are the only place on Grand street with a sidewalk cafe and open French doors in the summertime.  I think it goes without saying that I'm a huge fan.  Maybe one of the biggest.  Go for lunch, go for brunch (if you're feeling festive, and not too crabby because brunch here is all about fun...) and make SURE you go for dinner.  I've overheard people at the bar talking about how they've driven all the way from the upper west side to enjoy this place and leaving with a smile.  That says alot to me.  And makes me proud to have a place like this just around the corner.  Way to go Le Barricou!!"
0,The best pizza I ever had so far! And...Their fried chicken is absolutely delicious!
0,"The food was okay; too salty for my palate. The stuffed artichoke was like leather, but I did not complain. One in our party was late arriving due to plane delays, and the hostess could not pass by our table without jeering. Since it is a small restaurant, I am sure it is important to turn tables frequently to maintain a healthy profit margin, but southerners do not like to rush through their meals. Had they told us upon making a reservation that our dining time would be from  5-6 we would have opted to eat somewhere else. Rudeness does not win stars! Hence, a star and a half!"
0,"By far my favorite restaurant in NYC. I started coming here with my bf when it first opened and I lived a few blocks away. It's cozy and vibrant and the food is absolutely SUPERB! I recommend the shrimp tacos, tuna tartare, paella, date pudding, and chocolate soufflé. Now that I no longer live in NYC I truly miss Heidi's and always make time for a dinner there when I am vacationing in NY. After frequenting this restaurant for almost three years now I can say that the excellent food and service have been consistent. The service is incredible, both Heidi and the manager, Freddy, know how to make your dining experience something special. Honestly, words cannot describe how much I love this place!"
1,eat in but do not under any circunstance take out we got there saturday...love bataly high expectations...place is masterfully disorganized so we eat at manzo  good food serveice not existeny so i am a foodie and i live in miami ....oh man sunday am i am buying everything arrive at 10 sharp head to the cheese and salumi counter ..one guy there  wait for 30 minutes and buyt some pecorino and some gorg...go to murrays  better cheese better service mozzarella bar had no mozzarella   she said he said we ar mking it for the restaurant so u cant buy it  uh? head to the butcher  veal cutlets...its italian..pork chopps   veal hops and steaks got home and cooked them awfull slymie and not good quality get it dont but the stuff go to citarella but eat there its good
1,"This place is relaxing.  Yes, it's loud and crowded, but it's also without pretention and everyone there is so damn friendly so you can really get comfortable. Order the clam chowder.  It goes so well with a cold beer.  Creamy heaven."
1,"-I hate fries but must admit these fries are pretty darn delicious! -Regular size comes with a ginormous amount of fries!!  My husband and I couldn't finish them!   -The two guys that helped us were super sweet, nice, and accommodating.  They gave us samples to try and it was super helpful considering they have such a long list of sauces!   -Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo is a must try!   -$4.50 for regular fries + $1.50 for sauce.  I think they should give a bigger portion of the sauce because the amount of fries we received was not enough for the tiny cup of sauce.   -Place is super cramped but feels really homey.  I like."
0,First time here at Bayou on a Wednesday night. I must say I was impressed. First off the staff were very friendly. I was also very surprised to notice a live jazz musician playing for us. It was quite pleasant. The food was great as well! We had a prix fixe special and the portions were not small. They were quite filling actually. The restaurant decor was also very cute. I would definitely come back and recommend this cute restaurant to my friends!
0,"Excellent food, a jewel everytime. Tea selection excellent. Only complaint? Use of tetsubin incorrect for Japanese tea. Over heating the water by some staff. If they made the tea with as much attention as the tea selection or the cooking I would be there everyday."
0,"This place is a gem -- and considering the lack of food offerings in this neighborhood, it is a diamond in the rough. The owner is friendly and welcoming, and always takes the time to chat about what's new on the menu. He's also wonderfully accommodating of my questions (I'm a strict vegetarian and  an inordinately picky eater, so I always have questions). The prices are a little steep for my budget, but it's an excellent treat. The macaroni and cheese is completely addictive, and the eggplant caponata makes my toes tingle. I do wish there was a sit-down area, though. It would be a great place to take friends who venture out to the neighborhood."
1,This place makes me feel like I'm in San Jose or Milpitas again. I do believe the Vietnamese food is better on the West Coast (you can challenge me on this if you have substantial evidence). Ba Xuyen does however make one yelplicious banh mi for the price and quality. Plus the ladies behind the counter are usually quite nice and thoroughly entertained by my Chenglish. The bread is toasted and there is a selection of other goodies if you choose not to go the sandwich route. Two friends actually just went on a romantic getaway to Vietnam...the food must be phenomenal.
0,Excellent food with lots of choices - almost too many to choose from! Great for both group dinners or a date. Would definitely recommend to any of my friends.
0,"I LOVE this place. The food is amazing, the people are amazing. The atmosphere is perfect. We held a happy-hour fundraiser at Swine and it couldn't have been better. The owners and staff went above and beyond to make sure the event was a success.  The ambience is fun and low-key, with a wonderful drink selection and REALLY incredible food.  The Bone Marrow & Brisket Burger is seriously the best burger I have had in my life. Also, don't miss the Potato Chip Nachos or the Bacon Wrapped Dates! Go!"
0,"It's rustic, cosy and fashionable all at the same time. It was a busy day, we ended up moving tables from outside to inside without a fuss despite the wait staff clearly under pressure. Our meals were great - pancakes given the thumbs up, huge generous serve and two of us enjoyed the five leaves burger.. to be picky, the beetroot relish was just beetroot slices but overall a delicious Aussie inspired burger. Truffle chips extra naughty and subtle in flavour. I'd return."
0,Where else can you get raw oysters and vespers served by tuxedoed barkeep?
0,Best pizza in the world! I am not exaggerating. Dom is a pizza master and makes everything right in front of you. The quality of the ingredients is obvious from the taste. The only downfall is the wait but this is best pizza you will ever get!
0,great!
0,"Decent french food but not worth returning unless it is empty and there is no wait. They don't employ a maitre d' and the ""i am trying really hard"" to be super french staffer doesn't keep a waiting list. Typical of many pompous waiters and restaurants that think they can remember everything without writing it down---makes them even more special i guess. Anyway, the place was packed, they made no efforts at controlling the crowd flowing thru the door and despite acknowledging us several times when we identified some jerk trying to cut the line, the lame staffer still sat them ahead of us and all he could say was oops sorry-made a mistake. Having waited for more than 45 minutes and then that happens was disappointing. We told the owner and she was adamant that he kept a waiting list. Don't think she will be in business long. The food is just not that exponentially better than places that have more professional staff. If it is busy, be prepared to police the line yourself so mr frenchy doesn't let his pals sit first---although this time i think he was just slipped some cash!!!"
1,Chicken biscuit is to die for and pies are always amazing. The fried chicken is one of the best in the country let alone nyc. Btw update they accept credit cards now.
1,"Soonduboo! As a through and through carnivore with little experience with Korean food aside from the KBBQ and food court fare everyone's had, I'll be honest: I was apprehensive about eating anywhere that specialized in what sounds like mere tofu soup. Why buy here when amazing grill chicken, pork, and beef awaits me on the same block? Consider me converted. Soonduboo tastes absolutely amazing, with or without meat, and generously filling. The service is fast and friendly and prices are more than reasonable for the amount of food you get. I've tried the beef and seafood options and loved every bite. My only gripe: tea is way too darn expensive here."
0,"I have been going to this place for a very long time but lately the quality of the food dropped significantly. The chicken does not taste good at all. The only thing they have going for them is the ""white sauce"". I used to go here at least once a month, now I refuse to go..."
0,"Good, high quality food. Great space and very large. Staff is top notch. Prices are a tiny bit high, but a great addition to the east village."
1,"Go with a friend or loved one or both or just by yourself or with the mayor or a pet and order both the artichoke slice and a regular slice.  The two work together, tag-team, to kick your tastebuds butt! They really balance each other out. I guess you can go with a coworker or a date or your accountant or cousin. Order both flavors. The people here are also remarkebly nice."
1,"The ambiance was great, the food was tasty, and the service was excellent.  We tried the fried goat cheese on toast, patatas braves, albondigas, gambas al ajillo, sliced steak, and chorizo wrapped witth potato.  All of our choices were delicious.  We ended the meal with the coconut flan. We went on a Thursday evening and enjoyed a flamenco show while we ate with great music.  It reminded me of being in Spain. Our server, Unua, was so accommodating and friendly.   We will definitely be back!"
0,"Sergimmo Salumeria has the best Italian food I ever had. If you are on Manhathan you better go and taste some of the best Italian food!! I would totally recommend this place, people is super nice and food is delicious! Don't leave Sergimmo Salumeria before trying the VIP panini! No words to describe this awesome panini!!! Janise -- from Argentina"
0,"Now, I'm no ramen expert. But I bet you aren't either. I bet you just like good food and you're looking for a nice meal in a nice restaurant with nice servers and nice atmosphere. Chuko fits the bill on all counts. My only previous experience with ramen was through a different restaurant on Vanderbilt which shall remain nameless--a more casual spot that shuttered rather quickly after its opening due to the mediocrity of its food. Based on that experience of overly salty strange-tasting brothy vegetables, I couldn't quite imagine what all the hubbub over ramen was about. Chuko convinced me halfway through our appetizers that it could deliver seriously delicious food in unexpected combinations. The spicy pickle special wowed me, as did the surprisingly complex and savory kale salad. My dining companions were bowled over by the brussel sprout dish, of which I only had a small though tasty bite. Then came the ramen. I opted for the vegetable broth with market veggies and soft-poached egg. Two sips in and I totally understood the hype of ramen. The broth was utterly satisfying and flavorful without at all being overly salty. The egg gave a lovely richness, and the veggies which included some kind of green sprouts, winter squash, and what appeared to be roasted parsnips provided texture and a pleasant subtle sweetness. I may know nothing about ramen, but I do know that I finished every last morsel of food placed in front of me. Two hours later I was craving for more and when I woke up this morning my first thought was about how much I enjoyed dinner last night. I can not wait to go back to Chuko. And I can not wait to see what kinds of wine and beer they serve after they get their liquor license."
1,Cheesyyyypoooffs!
0,"This spot never lets me down!  BEST RAMEN IN NYC!   I'm not a noodle/ramen person so this is a complete surprise for me.  I was pretty hesitant to try this place at first.  It was love at first slurp. Of all the many times I've gone to this place, I've never had to wait for more than 15 minutes.  Maybe it's because I usually go during off hours.  Service is great and you're greeted by the entire staff!  Wonderful!   My favorite dish is Akimaru Ramen.  It's usually spicy but now I have to ask for it...a tiny dish of hot stuff 2 bucks!  What a rip...but hey it's GOOOOOOOD. The best deal is the lunch special.  You get a small rice dish, salad, and of course your ramen noodle soup.  Very affordable and it will leave you in a food coma.  Yea, it's that good.  My only grip is that other than the ramen, they put japanese mayo in almost every other thing.  I would have enjoyed their awesome pork buns if it wasn't for the mayo.  The last time I ask for one without mayo, the waitress made a face, thus, I'll never order it again.  They also put mayo in the tiny rice bowl...eww. Other than that, the food is amazing.  The decor is very trendy and yet I love staring at the walls filled with Japanese characters.  Always a great time there!  Will definitely be back!"
0,"I previously wrote a review and gave Lamarca four stars. I'm now giving it ONE star. Why, you ask? Because I found out that they use Barilla pasta. I saw an entire stash of all sorts of Barilla pastas in their shelves behind the counter. They are royally ripping the customer off! You can buy Barilla pasta at the grocery store for pennies on the dollar, and they charge you the very expensive price of $7.05 for a bowl at the cafe. (Where the hell did they come up with the idea to charge the extra nickel, anyway? It's just fucking irritating for the customer if you don't have a nickel with you, and then you have to keep 95 cents worth of change in your pocket the whole day). They must be making a FORTUNE ripping their customers off! Please, please, PLEASE, do NOT go to this horrible restaurant who are knowingly ripping their unsuspecting customers off! That is, unless you like bending over and being raped with high prices for the same generic Barilla pasta you KNOW you can purchase at the grocery store for under $2 for an entire bag of pasta! SPREAD THE WORD SO EVERYONE WILL KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT LAMARCA AND RIPPING THEIR CUSTOMERS OFF!"
0,"I've eaten here a couple of times,  the food is ok, if you don't know how to cook for your self..... BUT THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE, VERY UN~FREINDLY it seems that they are pissed off that you are in there restaurant... well never go again I'LL NEVER GO BACK, So if you like average food, and like being treated like Shit, this might be your place......"
0,"Shrim parm n penne vodka all the time I visit. The portions are enormous n delicious . Wait staff are pros , can't wait till I visit next time ."
1,"Nyonya is consistently good. I often go here just to pick up the Roti Canai and Singapore Noodles. The Roti Canai is a flaky, yet buttery flat bread served with chicken or pork curry. I tend to stay clear of pork so instead of pork in my noodles, I ask for shrimp. Dining in is good for both small and big parties. If you don't want to walk away smelling like food, I suggest ordering to-go. The wait staff knows what is good on the menu so don't be shy asking them to recommend dishes. Cash only! This place gets pretty crowded during dinner time. Arrive for an early dinner to avoid the wait time."
1,"It was love at first bite.... There are so many great things I can go on and on about Puerto Viejo, I mean I can write a book about the great experience the bf and I have had the three times we've dined here but really all you need to know is that this place exceeded our expectations and we HIGHLY recommend it. It is the best Dominican food we've had in NY. The mix of flavors took me back to 1995 when I was still in DR, eating authentic delicious food....who makes black beans with a rich smokey taste anymore other than your Dominican grandma?? Puerto Viejo. We had a long chat with Eduardo, one of the sons of the owners, who educated us on the background of the restaurant and new plans he has. We were amazed to know that they have been there for 26 years catering to the workers from the nearby factories, auto shops, etc., but recently underwent a complete renovation. This brings me to decor of the restaurant, it has an industrial, vintage, romantic feel. The music, the vibe, it's just all perfect. Make sure you don't leave without trying the white Sangria! So far everything we have ate has been amazing! Wascar, our server was awesome! Please note: they only serve a Brunch menu on Sundays, if you go in on a Saturday, you will find a typical Dominican breakfast menu as well as most lunch options. I hope soon they will consider serving the Brunch menu on Saturdays as well. Looking forward to my next time!"
1,"This is def my new fav for delivery.  You know a place has good food when it can be served in a cardboard box and taste just as good as if it were at the place on a plate. Brooklyn Star makes magic.  The mac n cheese is unfair how creamy it is and yet crispy and baked just right on the edges.   The only disappointment was the corn bread, I was craving corn bread... gritty, textured, corn bread and theirs was more like a cake.  Ours was minus the Jalpenos so I'm thinking maybe with them in might have been better. Country Fried Steak, 1/2 Roast Chicken (with that insanely incredible rice), Texas Toast, and of course the Mac n Cheese are all 5 stars in my eyes, my belly is happy yet again thanks to the star."
1,great pizza and a good location--fun to walk over the BK bridge beforehand to work up an appetite
1,"Well priced (for the neighborhood), well portioned, and never dissapointing. Any of the Quesadillas, and a Tecate, and I'm satiated for about $12.00."
1,"Small, quaint, and intimate...atmosphere is wonderful.  The server (owner of sorts?) was a treat and made us feel completely at ease.  Felt like we were guests in her home. The atmosphere and menu complement each other perfectly.  Not a pretentious menu.  Just great plays on classics, implemented perfectly.  The corn chowder and salmon tartare were spot on. Highly Recommended."
1,The good: - Amazing soup dumplings. - Great food in decent prices. - Round communal tables make it perfect for groups. - And of course the BYOB policy! The bad: - It's the Chinese version for Seinfeld' soup natzi. Expect very rude service - Far from everything else and long lines
0,I've been coming here for years!  Its a great spot that has always been a reliable place to hang out with friends over dessert and coffee or a good meal.
0,"Nice vibe, I love the candles they put everywhere in the restaurant, the desserts are excellent!"
1,"As a life long vegetarian, I have always struggled to find purely vegetarian ramen. My friend had been raving about this place for a long time so finally we decided to try it out. Be prepared to wait well over an hour. There is always a long line! As a vegetarian there were only two options I could choose from, one was just a spicier version of the other one, so really it's just one- but I'll take what I can get. We got the spicy vegetarian ramen and it was delicious! My only complaint was they were a bit stingy on the avocado. It's supposed to come with avocado, but we couldn't find any in our entire bowl of ramen! The vegetarian ramen is made from a mushroom soup base, which I really appreciated. I love when restaurants take vegetarians into consideration. Can't complain much about this place, just wish it didn't have such a long wait. To their credit, the food comes out surprisingly fast."
1,"I do like their coconut icecream, especially its tropical look. The ""crispy watercress salad"" did not come up to my expectation, though. Next time I might try their pan-fried egg. It looks like thai omelet in the menu :)"
1,"So my friend chose this place to have her birthday dinner.  It was pretty quiet since it was a Tuesday night at 7pm...   Likes: Good bread- the little bread balls are so delicious and soft!  And it comes with this black hummus like dip.   Drinks- we all got the tropical sangria.  YUM.  I really want to come back for brunch with endless sangria! Chipotle Ketchup- I got the yuca fries and they came with some delicious ketchup.  I have a thing for ketchup... and calle ocho's was some good stuff.  I had to ask for refills. Mehs: Empanadas-I wasn't too hungry so I got the empanada app.  The empanada of the day was chicken something or other.  While the chicken was good, the empanada was kind of dry.   All in all, the decor of the place is nice, the service is good (they refill your water without you having to ask), and drinks are tasty.  If you're looking for awesome food though... try elsewhere."
1,"Taim is my absolute favorite place for a quick, satisfying, and cheap lunch. Their falafel comes in three different flavors; I prefer harissa although it isn't that spicy. Ask for pickles and s'rug (Yemeni hot sauce made of cilantro, chili, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil) in your sandwich!"
0,"We had a birthday party in the library at the back of the house and up the stairs. It was a charming and comfortable room surrounded by books. Our waiter could not have been more attentive and service was superb. The food just kept coming - bruschetta, tomato/mozzarella, salad, steak, branzino and two desserts. Everthing was well prepared and tasty. In summary, an amazing restaurant in the heart of a vibrant part of NYC."
0,"so so good.  as with other reviewers, conflicted between telling others about it for fear of lucali-esque lines forming.  so it sucks.  go away."
1,"5 stars. Was at Legend's on 33rd watching Argentina vs Belgium during the WC. Went to Seoul Lee's Korean BBQ after seeing it on WNYE with Kelly Choi and I must say the Korean tacos kick butt! Also the owner hooked me up 2 chicken wings after mentioning Kelly Choi . The wings were delicious , waay better than regular buffalo ones. Went back after the Holland game a second time, quality still top notch."
1,"Delicious Brussels sprouts, really good shrimp cocktail, and yes we had the steak for two and it was insane. Seriously two people should not eat 42 oz of steak, ever, and that was the smallest one they had. I had no choice, I was on a paleo diet so that was my only option. Super pricey but we did eat it for another two meals! Good creme brûlée too! All in all everything was great, I didn't give it five stars only because I'd expected nothing less at those prices in this neighborhood, and there was nothing terribly unexpected that could get my juices flowing for five stars. I'll certainly go again sometime I'm sure!"
0,"I  made a lunch reservation for ABC kitchen and arrived a few minutes early.  I have no problem waiting since I was the one who was early.  I checked in with 1 of 3 hostesses and was told it would be a few more minutes.I waited and waited..then almost 30 minutes later I noticed they were seating people who arrived later than me, before me!  I expressed my frustration to one of the hostesses and FINALLY after standing in front of her did me and my guest get seated.I wouldn't go back since service was terrible.  My food was OKAY and the dessert was fantastic- salted carmel sundae.  But, I wouldn't go back just for  dessert because the restaurant is very disorganized.  As I was leaving I noticed the same frustrated looks on other people waiting."
1,"Surprise surprise, I'm an Asian that doesn't like pho or ramen.  So when I stumbled upon Soba-ya I quickly got excited and the quest was on to find someone who was willing to have Japanese noodles from neither Minca or Ippudo (both good but like I said I'm not a fan of ramen.) Soba, as it brings me to a ""natsukashi"" place, is definitely my favorite Asian noodle and Soba-ya gets it right.  I wish I wrote my review right after I went because I can't remember what was had, but I can say I've been there 2 more times since my initial visit.  What's great, is with my first check-in with yelp I got a free glass of sake. Oh yeah, their toilets, Toto."
0,Went there for the first time today.  I live within a block of this restaurant and I am so glad it's here.  I love northeast kingdom's food but have been disappointed with the attitude of the staff. No attitude at all in this place.  Food was also amazing.  I had the grass fed burger and it was cooked beautifully and delicious. Everyone is super nice and the place has a lot of charm and personality. The bathroom has family pictures and pictures of the prior owner.  I like that the owners are carrying on/ respecting the previous history (maintaining the old sign etc.) while definitely putting their own stamp on things.  Very personal and warm.  My hope is that they expand somehow - it's a bit snug!  But that will come if they keep up their cheery service and excellent offerings.  Well done Cafe Ghia!  I love Wyckoff Starr too.  Nice to see the success continuing.  Really contributes to the neighborhood.
1,"I know I've mentioned this place in regards to its drinks but I've finally had the opportunity to eat here for brunch and dinner.  I have yet to try something that isn't fantastic.  Upon arrival, regardless of time of day, just go with whatever has ""short ribs"" in it.  That's been my gameplan and I have yet to be disappointed.  You literally feel like you are family here but without the ""diner"" feel.  I LOVE this place and constantly come back to what feels like a unique, perfect experience every time.  It's perfect for birthdays, dates, family night, friends, etc."
0,The food is amazing and the service is decent. It's a good restaurant overall but it gets really crowded at night.
1,"Great atmosphere, quality food, and decent service... this place ticks boxes. Throw in the added bonus of spinning the wheel (after which we enjoyed free wings!!) and you can't go wrong here!! Definitely worth checking out."
1,Good atmosphere and we were able to find an open table at 1am so that's cool.  We were really excited to try some of the food but unfortunately the kitchen closes at midnight so missed out.  We also missed out on the happy hour prices  but even without the happy hour prices the lychee martin is only $8 compared to $16 at the W.  A pretty chill place and the kind of atmosphere we were looking for.
1,Fish tacos were utterly amazing
0,"Intimate, friendly service, great price considering it's good French food in Manhattan. The BYOB policy keeps the bill down, as does not having a corking fee. (The lone server reminded us the wine shop around the corner made deliveries when our bottle ran low.) We four tried four different entrees, split two appetizers and two desserts, and enjoyed it all."
1,"Cafe Cluny is your typical West village cafe, with a kitchen and staff probably up to par for brunch, but nothing more challenging than that. I went there for dinner at the invitation of a friend who lives in NYC. The dinner menu was quite boring, nothing inventive and I would argue it's more modern American than close to the boundaries of French cuisine. Ordered the Steak Frites medium rare and a cocktail, which did the job but didn't blow me away. For a restaurant charging $120 for 2 mains and 2 drinks, you'd expect a *little* more fireworks. I also don't get how the servers expect you to hang your winter coat ""anywhere around the room where there's a hook"". Maybe it's a New York thing but I would've expected assistance for a place attempting to be chi chi."
0,The poutine here is the best drunk food of all time.
1,"Super fantastic amazing delicious wonderful.  Wow.  Love.  LOVE.  I went here with a group of friends on a Saturday night.  We made a reservation but the hostess was a wee bit pissed when a few people were late because she refused to seat us without the entire party there but then she also wouldn't hold the reservation for more than 15 minutes.  Anyway, it worked out and she got over it.  We ordered two pitchers of sangria which ended up being really expensive! $40 each!  So delicious though.  We ordered guac just because that is a necessity.  Also, each of us ordered two tapas which ended up being a lot more food than we realized.  I ordered the lobster quesadillas which were fine but not WOW and then I ordered the espresso bbq ribs which were FAN-F*ING-TASTIC.  I am partial to ribs but these were just phenomenal.  NYC food in general is great, food on 7th Ave is particularly wonderful, but this place is WOW."
0,"The wait is EPIC!  two hours for pancakes, man.  But I have to say, it is, hand down the best pancake I've had. People are friendly and serve your snackies to compensate while you wait.  I say go."
1,"This place is really a hidden gem. It was a really slow night when I went on Friday around 8PM. Before heading in to the restaurant, my significant other and I popped into the deli next door to grab some beers, heeding the tips of BYOB. Immediately after stepping in, it felt like we were at one of our Filipino friend's family gatherings. The server is incredibly friendly and patient with describing the traditional homemade dishes. We ordered the chicken adobo, the crispy pata, and the pancit. And the portions were HUGE for two people. We couldn't even finish it. While we were eating, our server decided to sing along to karaoke, giving it a really friendly and laid back atmosphere. They even offered for us to sing but we were too busy stuffing our faces. Love this place. So awesome for a great vibe and awesome food."
0,Had late lunch here.  Food was delish and Happy Hour Prosecco all you can drink!  The meat and cheese board was fabulous and  good prices.   Staff very friendly and attentive and great atmosphere.
0,"This place is one of my all-time favorite restaurants.  The beef stew and ropa vieja are my favorites.  Delicious black beans, red beans and yellow rice.  Really good coffee and flan for dessert.  My Puerto Rican friend once told me to try the ""morrir soñando"" and it was AMAZING.  It was frothy and creamy and reminded me of a creamsicle.  It's also unbelievably cheap.  If you want some delicious, affordable food this is the place for it."
1,"There's a reason why this place always has a line out the door come diner time. In my opinion, Kyklades ranks #1 on Best Greek Taverna in all of Queens and if you're looking for a great seafood restaurant, look no further! The food, ESPECIALLY the seafood, is well-seasoned and fresh, the wait staff is always bustling about (at times the owner will chat with the customers, making sure they are left completely satisfied), and at the end of the meal you're treated with dessert (usually halva). Everything on the menu is pretty darn good, (I've been coming here long enough with my fam to know ;) but my personal favorites have to be the PEASANT SALAD, GRILLED OCTOPUS, and the GRILLED WHITING with the POTATO &GARLIC SPREAD. What's great about this place is that it caters to all palates. If you're more of a carnivore, try the PORK CHOPS or the ""BIFTEKIA"" (Greek style hamburgers). They come with your choice of a variety of veggies and any style of potato (the side dishes are scrumptious as well). And if you're a vegetarian , than this will be your culinary haven; the STUFFED GRAPE LEAVES, STEAMED DANDELIONS, and the varieties of salads will surly impress. The atmosphere is nice, the food tastes homemade (and Giagia approved!), and the prices are fair. Kyclades, beyond any doubt, is my favorite taverna in all of Astoria and after a meal here it'll probably be yours too. Kali oreksi! Bon appetite!"
0,"One of my favorite restaurants. GREAT food, great service. I recommend ordering a taster's menu. They will ask you how much you want to spend and chose various dishes for you. It is a great way to sample the menu especially if it is your first time. Also, the Tofu Salad is one of the best things that ever went into my mouth. There is a better ambiance when they are a bit slower. It can get crowded around prime days/times which makes the seating a bit awkward."
0,"This was one of my best restaurant experiences ever. And not only because of the food (which was very good) but because of the atmosphere that I have encountered there. I went to this place to celebrate my father's 75th birthday. The waitress was so attentive and so friendly and warm that after the dinner we felt like we became close friends, taking photos all together and chatting just about anything.   My parents are really hard to satisfy when it comes to restaurants and when I told them that we are going to a very small but cozy place instead of fancy and posh one at first they weren't impressed. But as soon as they walked in and staff started taking care of them they were swept of their feet and at the end they told me that it was probably one of the best birthday celebrations ever. Thank you Uli ! Thank you Petite Crevette! Misha."
1,"So often when eating out, one course will be extraordinary and other courses don't quite match it. At Bababoosta, everything tasted wonderful. We had two appetizers, two entrees and shared a dessert. I'd like to go back and explore every other item on the menu."
1,"Lemme start this review off by saying that: People who are used to diner food and nothing better are going to LOVE this place.. Anyone else will realize that Clinton St Baking Company is nothing more than an extremely long wait for an overhyped breakfast. As everyone else has mentioned, you will be waiting A WHILE before you get a table, so plan on either going really early or eating really late.  One of the reasons for the long wait is the fact that the place is TINY.  There is absolutely nothing special about it..  Looks like any other diner with the window to the kitchen right in your face..  I ordered the blueberry pancakes and to this day I ABSOLUTELY DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FUSS IS ABOUT.  The pancakes are heavy and leave you with nothing more than a wasted morning and a stomach ache. Oh and to top things off on the ""shit-scale"", this place only takes cash.."
1,Iconic place but they probably have slipped their standards in recent years. Got served a stone cold omelet for breakfast.
0,Love this place... had the tasting menu a few weeks ago.... out of this world. Only negative comment would be the vegetarian option was basically the same as the regular option sans meat.... didnt work well to share for two. service was out of this world. :)))))
1,"I honestly don't see what the hype is about this place! The fries are decent and the sauces are creative, but it's far from 5 stars. I tried the pesto mayo, which was decent, and the frites sauce, which is basically just mayo. I felt sick afterwards, though."
0,"I work in the area and just happened to walk by as the place was DEAD empty. I walked in anyway and saw an AMAZING array of treats that looked fresh and ready for the taking. I wasn't in a position to buy nor was it in my ""diet"" plan for the day, but I vowed to come back... Well I did tonight and it was empty... again. The case looked less exciting than before, most of their product was nonexistent, and I wasn't in the mood for a muffin at 8pm. I asked if they had any cookies and the man there told me there were some chocolate chip just about to come out of the oven. Within SECONDS the timer beeped and the woman preparing the next batch mix, un-gloved, re-gloved and pulled them out of the oven... FRESH COOKIES STRAIGHT OUT DA OVEN, YA'LL!!! I HAD to get me one of those joints! Normally I am a fan of the WHOLE FOODS vegan chocolate chip cookies, but THIS RIGHT here at CHAMPS was on POINT! Think Levain Bakery thickness with a gazillion mini chocolate kosher chip something or others, yet and AMAZING cookie to chocolate ratio! Well balanced in the sweetness, but not so chocolaty that all your tongue is coated and you miss something. Good crust on the bottom, but so soft everywhere else. Yeah, before I got half way through the first one, I quickly purchased one for the road! $3 seems steep for a cookie at a spot I've never been, but my belly and taste buds was not mad at it. I was so excited I was sing praises to random people on the street. Some went in to get in on it! I'll be back..."
0,"I go here a lot. I love the place. I take my mother here whenever she comes into the city. We have had the mac and cheese sample plate thing with three different types of mac and cheese and it is delicious!! It's rich and creamy and cheesy, everything I want in mac and cheese. If you're gonna do mac and cheese, do it right., where you don't want to stop eating no matter how full you feel. We shared a salad and it was fantastic, I cant remember the name of it. However I do remember it being fresh and crisp and balanced in lettuce to dressing ratio, which is a big plus in my book. We had the fried oreos and shake shooter. I loved it. I've gone there just for dessert a couple times. They do rich and delicious well for me. The food is decadent and the cocktails are really well mixed. I have not had a bad experience, even with the line for a table, ever. It is one of my favorite little places and I love the ambiance and decor. It's very chic and upbeat. Great place to grab appetizers and drinks or a full sit down meal. Fabulous in my book."
1,"We came for a 10:30pm Sunday dinner and were still offered great food and service.  Our server was super-nice, and all of the dishes were awesome.  Lamb sweetbreads with bacon, grilled asparagus with duck confit and fried oysters, molasses brined porkchop, charred poundcake with strawberries, and the crazy smores chocolate pudding just about killed us.  Prices were extremely reasonable."
1,"Yum!  I ordered delivery from here and got a pizza with speck, ricotta, artichokes, and smoked mozzarella (the affumicata).  It arrived warm and within 30 minutes.  The crust was chewy and the toppings complemented it perfectly.  The speck was salty and delicious, very good with the creamy ricotta.  I will definitely be ordering from here again."
1,"Every now and then, I have a little food fantasy about Pomme Frites. Just saying ""pomme frites"" makes me feel more classy. I tried the War Sauce, Roasted Garlic Mayo, and Mango Chutney Mayo. All were delicious. It's a small little place, but a gentleman kindly made room for me at one of the tables, so I was able to enjoy my paper cone comfortably."
1,"I'm not Thai and I've never been to Thailand, but I love Thai food (at least what get in the U.S.).  That said, I was very satisfied with Pure Thai.   It's a very small and very popular place in Hell's Kitchen.  I stopped in on a Monday evening (7:30ish) in early January 2015. The place was packed and newcomers were offered a 45-60 minute wait.  I was alone and accepted a corner ""bar"" seat -- which was marginally more than a bus stop seat. I've sat in more unusual seats in various parts of the world, so I was happy to be seated quickly. I ordered a IPA beer and their shrimp, asparagus, and Bok Choy dish. I requested it ""Thai hot"".  I received about 5-6 decent sized shrimp and a generous portion of vegetables.  The asparagus were fairly thinly sliced and the Bok Choy consisted mainly of the green leafy part. I also received a bowl of perfectly cooked rice. Although I requested it ""Thai hot"", it was only ""pretty spicy"".   However, everything else was very good -- fresh and perfectly cooked. I likely would have given them five stars if my dish was ""Thai hot""."
0,Pesto lasagna. To die for.
